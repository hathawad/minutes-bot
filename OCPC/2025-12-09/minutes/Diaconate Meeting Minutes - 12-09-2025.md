## 3\. Recap of Previous Events & Projects

### A. Reformation Sunday Picnic

- Event ran very smoothly despite intermittent rain.  
- Team adapted quickly by moving food-service tables under cover.  
- Recommendations for next year:  
  - Have towels available (not only paper towels).  
  - Keep lightweight plastic sheeting on hand for covering tables in bad weather.

### B. Mulching Day

- Boy Scouts delivered mulch on time and at a lower cost.  
- **460 bags** was nearly perfect; suggest adding **5–12 bags** next year to reduce end-of-project shuffling.  
- Early trimming done by a few volunteers helped finish the work under three hours.  
- Trudy’s marking of “no-mulch zones” was very helpful.  
- Plan to implement additional short landscaping days throughout the year.

### C. Turkey Drive

- Successful event—approximately **550 families** served.  
- Minor shortage required a supplemental purchase at BJ’s.  
- Vendor count verification remains important to avoid past issues.

### D. Christmas Concerts

- Very strong attendance—possibly the largest to date.  
- **Issues Identified:**  
  - No security presence at Davis Chapel for rerouted guests.  
  - Heavy traffic and pedestrian congestion at Old Cutler Road (144th).  
  - Livestream audio inconsistencies due to limited iPad-based setup.  
- **Suggestions:**  
  - Shift concert start times by **30 minutes** to spread attendance.  
  - Increase gap between concerts from **1 hr to 1.5 hrs** to allow parking lots to reset.  
  - Long-term investment needed in streaming/audio equipment.  
  - Additional tech volunteers would help support complex events.

## 4\. Upcoming Events

### A. December 24 – Christmas Eve Services (5 PM & 7 PM)

- Deacons asked to sign up for ushering at one of the two services.  
- Expect seat-filling challenges similar to the Christmas concert.  
- Parking assistance may be needed depending on turnout.

### B. January 2026 – Fellowship Event

- Target: **late January or early February**.  
- Potential hosts: **Emmanuel** or **Doug**.  
- Final date to be confirmed.

## 5\. Ministry Coordinator Updates

### A. Cooling Tower Replacement / A/C System

- Engineering review requires new **structural drawings** due to updated code (approx. $1,450).

- Electrical disconnect boxes and conduits are corroded and require replacement; circuits must be upgraded to **30 amps**.  
- Quotes will be obtained for electrical contractor work.

### B. Roof Beam Repairs
