## 3. Recap of Previous Events

### A. Christmas Eve Services

- Services ran smoothly overall
- Discussed seating and crowd management improvements for future high-attendance events

### B. Christmas Concert Review

Extensive discussion on issues from the Christmas concert (next year is the **50th anniversary**):

**Issues Identified:**
- Doors had to be closed due to fire capacity—created frustration for families with reserved seats
- Someone called the fire department during the first concert
- Heavy traffic and pedestrian congestion at Old Cutler Road / 144th Street
- Davis Chapel overflow lacked live experience
- Quick turnaround between concerts (musicians "inhaling food" between shows)
- Reserved seating system caused conflicts when families arrived late

**Suggestions for Next Year:**
- Implement ticketing system (free or small donation) to manage capacity
  - Could use QR codes or simple "show on phone" verification
  - Leave some seats without tickets for walk-ins
  - Tickets help discourage attendance when "sold out"
- Shift concert start times by **30 minutes** to spread attendance
- Increase gap between concerts from **1 hr to 1.5 hrs** to allow parking reset
- Consider spreading concerts over **two days** (Friday/Saturday) instead of same evening
- Use clickers/counters at doors to track capacity in real-time
- Communicate overflow to Davis Chapel before capacity is reached
- Security presence needed at Davis Chapel for rerouted guests
- Arrange marked police vehicle or golf cart with lights for traffic control
- Paint parking lines in grass overflow areas
- Long-term investment needed in streaming/audio equipment
- Recruit additional tech volunteers for complex events

**Action Item:** Adam to present improvement ideas to appropriate leadership (Sean, Ray, staff)

**Reference:** True North events ran Monday–Thursday with 320–400 attendance, always packed, people lined up 40 minutes early

### C. Spring Picnic – March 29 (preferred) or April 19 (backup)

- March 29 preferred (week before Easter) due to Palmetto Bay Seafood Festival conflict
- Need to confirm with Sports Grill / Eric Haas

## 5. Administrative

### A. Communication Platform

- Will set up and share with those not present
- IT support available for anyone unfamiliar with WhatsApp

### B. Deacon Nominations

## 6. Ministry Coordinator Updates

### A. Cooling Tower Replacement / A/C System

- Dina has signed off on permit documents—submitted to city
- Work expected to begin by end of January
- Previous structural concerns addressed

### B. Termite Treatment

**Two quotes received:**
- Orkin: **$114,450** (November quote)
- Terminix: **$98,764** (October quote)

**Discussion:**
- Entire campus fumigation required
- Terminix provided more detailed proposal with campus map and methodology
- Historical relationship with Orkin, but Terminix presentation was more thorough
- Timing: Can tent entire campus in afternoon, fumigate overnight, remove in 1–1.5 days
- Suggested timing: Thursday tent, Friday Joyland closed, Saturday clear, Sunday services unaffected
- Cannot delay due to ongoing roof/termite damage

**Decision:** Approved Terminix quote ($98,764)

### C. Sanctuary Roof Beam Repairs

**Background:**
- Beam fell off west side of sanctuary before holidays (no injuries)
- Fourth Generation Roofers (Robert) conducted exploratory inspection
- 14–16 of 16 beam ends required removal due to rot
- Rot caused by water collecting in copper caps where glue seams failed
- Gutter system insufficient—only two drain spouts due to basement constraints

**Current Status:**
- Exploratory work completed (~$15,000, from Dina's $30,000 facilities budget)
- Structural engineer required to sign off on safety and repair plan
- Robert's engineer lacked repair experience (only design)
- Ibrahim Sikav (church member, engineer) came out to assess
- Michael Capote connected team with experienced wood structure engineer
  - Family attends church, wants to contribute as ministry
  - Meeting scheduled for January 24 (Zoom or in-person)

**Scope:**
- Engineer must assess load impact of ~2 feet of beam loss
- Roof edge also rotted in some areas—needs repair
- Gutter/drainage system redesign needed (engineering specialty)
- Options: flush/seal existing beams vs. splice new sections (significant cost difference)

**Related Concern:** Joyland building second floor also showing deterioration—suggested for future assessment

### D. Mercy Ministry / CarePortal

- Team (Chris, Mike, Iain) trained on CarePortal system
- Recent case: Family moving to shelter needed basic necessities—handled today
- Ongoing: Financial assistance requests processed through application reviewed by Dina and Steve

**Melanie Woods Tool Sale:**
- Church member, recent widow
- Husband left shed full of tools (power tools, etc.)
- Son cataloged everything in spreadsheet
- She needs help selling—uncomfortable with online marketplace
- Wants to donate portion to church
- **Suggestion:** Estate auction service (charges buyer + seller percentage, handles everything)
- **Action Item:** Joe Sirgany to loop in with Melanie and auction contact

### E. Larry Sosa – Military Record Assistance

- Church member, Army veteran
- Discharged with CID flag on record (charges brought but dropped, no conviction)
- Flag affecting job applications and school transfers (accepted to Alabama)
- Lawyer specializing in military law quoted **$5,000** flat fee to clear record
- Lawyer appears qualified (all military defense work)
- Steve already helping; David Zack reviewed lawyer credentials

**Discussion:**
- Could potentially use Mercy Ministry funds (requires application)
- Clay Schmitt (Air Force, contract law) suggested as reference
- Christian Vega to check if uncle (retired colonel at Southern Command) knows anyone

**Note:** Doug's company (LawFi) provides loans for legal fees—may be relevant

## 7. Closing (8:34 PM)
