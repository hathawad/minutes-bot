Speaker 1 | 00:01
On mostly older adults. We keep this one here. Now, that doesn't mean we can't change. So on this one and this one both... If you look in your bag, you've got another set of pads in there. Now it's going to be for an adult. Says right on adult.
So this is the one that's in here. If you come outside, it's a teacher or one of the ministers. You got to look at the oldest guys on the campus first. Okay? So I'm just showing you that right now and I'll show you how we change them out for those at one time used. Yes. In fact, I have to teach kids or my date time. I go and look at them, I go, "Man, you've only got two in service, but not that you can't use them because I've done it before, but you should."
So here's what you do. Let's... I'm on the table. Yes, sir, there's a question of it's not based on weight. You go off.
Speaker 2 | 01:01
The age for...
Speaker 1 | 01:03
Going front, right? Yeah, but it's about five years old, it has the kilograms on there. Yeah, okay. You don't even need to take a... Let's suppose it's a lesson I sow. Put it inside. Let's suppose just lay it there. Let's suppose I'm in the office here and somebody says, "Hey, the child went down, so I grabbed this disibrator and sit there." I'm just grabbing this one right now because I know what it is, and I say, "It's a doll. Now what do I do?" It by reaching this bag here and pull this out. I get these pads out of here.
But anyway, pull that one out, grab the next one, which is in the bag, and you do the same thing to slide it right in there down and it's ready to go.
If you were going to use it. Now, if this was a real scenario, right at this point, I... And this is what's the very first thing we can do, even if you remotely think somebody is having a heart attack or lying on the ground. Yes, and that's what it says right on here. Call 911, so it doesn't have to be used to... Hey, go call 911. I got this, pick me up anywhere I want.
So you would do the very first thing when you open this up. You can't put it on the patients. Man or woman, doesn't matter. Now, we do have scissors here because you want to cut some stuff out.
So I will tell you and he'll tell you that sometimes you get these bras that don't come up and just cut them right off. Okay? But that's what the scissors are for. We do have a razor in the bags for bears.
If you get a bear, he's got a bit of hair on his chest. Yeah, just shave it off. Takes just a few seconds. It did that to me last month. Sad when I passed out and long story on the ground. You have somebody that knows how to do a pulse very well.
That's mine. But while I'm checking the pulse, you're getting this prepared for me. I'll say, "Go get the letter." He's down, I got only ground. I say he's unconscious, I'm going to be checking his pulse. I'm probably going to be checking right up here, okay?
Because that's where your best pulse is there.
Speaker 2 | 03:30
It looks like they're not going to be talking to you and that... So we're using this. Somebody that's passed out, that's not going to be...
Speaker 1 | 03:35
The way that they're out. They're out like a trap now they say the dizzy and all that other stuff. Yeah, you get them, you send them down or... Them down, whichever they feel best at, whatever they can breathe best at. 911.
But right here, guys, there are two minutes away if they're not out on call. Okay? But there are other units closed you this. So just to let you know this machine as it was doing, it'll talk you through everything. We'll listen.
Speaker 2 | 04:01
We'll listen to it again.
Speaker 1 | 04:03
Begin by removing all something from the patient's chest that... Okay, now what do I do?
Speaker 2 | 04:13
Let's wait for me to hook up.
Speaker 1 | 04:17
Just as mayor. Remove protected cover and take out life at EAs. Just pull this guy you bring to that right? Pull that up in the map and you can see where they go. One one.
Speaker 2 | 04:34
Here to talk for a while.
Speaker 1 | 04:41
In training mode. That's what you do. You put it on the patient and here's what it's going to tell you. It's going to tell you to stand clear analyzing the patient. So when they're analyzing the patient, where is using this as the boss always we're going to say, "Hey, don't touch him, leave wrong." Nobody touched the patient, I can tell you.
I've seen firefighters, paramedics, and even Gazette accidentally. They're sitting there holding the foot or they're holding the hand or... I mean, it'll get you and it hurts a lot. The Gus... So when it gets done analyzing, it's going to say, "Continue CPR, okay?"
So you jump up, you do CPR or make sure you dial 911. So that's telling you that it's not the heart. They're not an issue with the heart or might be an issue with the heart, but they're not cardiac arrest.
Most people, because I just had it happen the other day. I remember who was interested. Most people when they're excited... Unless you're a professional every day, you're trying to take a pulse.
It's difficult, it's extremely difficult. We can sit here, take each other's pulses. You may or may not feel it. If you're doing the karate, you're right here on the apple, and then you just slide it in your go and it's right there, both sides.
It depends if they're talking to you just... You can take it either way. Just to see if they have a third property they got. PayPal. But the main thing we're here tonight is so we know where these are. We know how to access them and we know how to do it. Now, let's say it says again, CPR so I'm just going to do it real quickly. Nowadays it is so simple. You go use a little guy here and out of sight trust like interlace your hands, be using your palms, your elbows straight with the patient.
What I'm doing is fast heartbeat, 123. Let me tell you, this will kick your behind, will kick you behind. You can only go really good. Now, what would you say?
Speaker 2 | 07:07
Two minutes, three sales, two minutes.
Speaker 1 | 07:09
Right around two minutes, and you're going to be exhausted, and then he's going to jump up. Same thing, mid sternum. We all know what the sternum is. You're right there. Finance Ster. You're right on top of Laser Games straight, and you really don't need to count anywhere because you're going to do them until you get changed out either way. Either way, you're from either side. It doesn't matter whatever side you have to be on. I sit right next to the wall. He fell.
Speaker 2 | 07:42
He's got only if you arrive the structure. Only if we're going to ride the structure can go the middle.
Speaker 1 | 07:54
You find the stir on this guy, it's the same thing.
You do CPR until you drop until he taps, he goes my turn and jumps on start compressions and I start looking for other people and that's all. Do professionals we have that we have masks and stuff like that? I don't, only if you're a professional and you've done it most of your life. I use the mask, okay, to breathe for the patient. There's. There's.
You know. You know who you are, what you've done in your life. And, you know, Nurse Meridic. Whatever military, any kind of, you know, because you're taking up time. And then you would you then you would be counting at the end of 15. You're too deep breaths. You have a bag one two and boom on right back on it. Soon as he's done with a second breath, boom right back down on it.
And you switch partners when you' give you breaths. But that's a lot of stuff. But it's not a lot's really simple. That is you. So, yeah, you download one, you open that thing up. You know, if the patients awake, you know, especially a woman, don't go ripping their clothes off.
You know, that's. That's what you. You see, by their color by there's no reactions. There's, you know, you can take the skin and you can twist it, you can get a ngie and they have no reaction. You know, there's something going on. What else would you add into that?
Speaker 2 | 09:32
Well, I think one of the things is that in the past you were taking CPR. A lot of the emphasis was on the breathing because that's the thing we think about first. So a lot of research has shown that you actually have enough oxygen because they're researching this all the time.
So you have enough oxygen still in your system when you're cardiac arrest that you don't need to air right away. What they found... Study after study is early CPR is what you need. Early defibrillation.
But you need effective CPR, and that's something even we do on the fire department. We'll postpone our airway management until we have good compressions going on and then... So air with what happens there, especially if you're not used to it.
First of all, people are like, "I don't want to do anything because I don't want to breathe for them. So what they found is that luckily, research shows that compressions are good enough, at least for the first few minutes. Eventually, they obviously going to need air.
So an early defibrillation... So that the defibrillator only shocks rhythms. It's basically your heart quivering. It doesn't flatline. It's not going to shock. Or if they have a rhythm that it sees as an actual rhythm, it's not going to shock.
So you're not going to shock the wrong rhythm if they're unconscious. So you would do the effective CPR. It's about 110. If you go way too fast, you're doing a disservice. You're not letting them recoil enough time for that part to expand back out.
If you go too slow... First off, if you're doing something that's great, so that's probably what they're going to run into here. We have it. The compression is a major thing, so the breathing is a side thing. We do have the masks.
I have a BBM. So if you get somebody that wants to incorporate that, you can't. But the focus here today is just to get comfortable doing the compressions.
Speaker 1 | 11:23
You brought up something that I didn't mention as you see me doing that. My hand is now leaving the chest. You don't want to get off the chest.
Speaker 2 | 11:33
But you want to make sure you're not resting on the chest as it goes. So the key with that is getting close. Get your knees in close and then just do it without bending like the movies show you doing it like this.
But obviously... But if you're not sure, especially with checking a pulse, because I've been doing this for thirty years now, almost thirty years, and there are still patients... I'm not sure if I pulse.
They found in research once again that medical professionals have the biggest delays in CPR because we're all arguing to... We have that if you don't as a lay person feel it, just do compression, they're out of it. Enough that you're comfortable checking a pulse, just do compressions.
I've had him wake up. I've had him not on me, but I've had bystanders start and start that they started. We've had people just pass out on Ocean Drive that they started to start CPR we've had a lot of seizures, actually, where people start compression because they turn blue and they're not good.
You're going to have a sore chest. You probably break a rib, but it's better than waiting to see. Then, most funny... You probably will break a rib, especially if they're older, the kids if you're not, but you're probably going to... If you're doing CPR, especially at older ones, that's the weirdest. They're dead. You can't get any more dead.
So after... So what you want to do is one person is immediately going down because there's a person there. So you can immediately start those compressions while you start setting up while you're turning it on. That person ideally is going to be working around you. You're not going to stop the compressions to get the path.
If it's a little bit lower here, the chest here, it's fine. We just get the chest and try to work around the guy doing compressions, and then as soon as this thing's ready to analyze, let it analyze.
Because you want the shock super early, but you don't want it to take about ten compressions to prime that pump in the heart to get it to be effective again. That's why minimize the stops. Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1 | 13:32
Yeah, that's ideal.
Speaker 2 | 13:37
Shock wants that... Tell you to immediately start CPR you don't wait. You don't wait to see if they wake up soon as they shock. Even us with the paramedics and we see a rhythm. It's immediately CPR we literally could do compressions until the moment we even have a charge ready to shock. They shock...
And we immediately started. No matter what the rhythm is, you just keep going.
Speaker 1 | 13:56
This machine will tell you after two minutes reanalyzing.
Speaker 2 | 14:01
Then it'll tell you to stop, touch a patient. It won't... Yes, so what I'll say is probably reanalyze. No shock advised, and then you can check to see if they have a pulse, but if they're still looking like junk, just do it.
I mean, maybe they're hypertensive. Sorry, shock until you know it. No, it'll let you... It runs its own show, it'll tell you what you can't override. Yeah, so you don't... We don't have any... Only the paramedics have the ones we can override everything.
So you want to override this? But it is... I mean, I bet on the calls where the PD gets there first and does the CPR into the fibrillator, and we get a fair amount of those patients back neurologically intact, not just back to go to a nursing home neurologically.
Speaker 1 | 14:51
So to get a safe range, best case scenario.
Speaker 2 | 14:55
You have one.
Speaker 1 | 14:57
Equipments.
Speaker 2 | 14:59
And...
Speaker 1 | 14:59
Then jump. That's the worst case scenario.
Speaker 2 | 15:01
You're by yourself.
Speaker 1 | 15:02
Yeah, you yell for somebody to call 091. Now, if you can't get in, you're all by yourself. You dropped your phone and hit the 911 button on your phone, and you start... Okay, and you start how fast? Since the moment that you engage and then you switch together because you're...
Speaker 2 | 15:25
Like thirty seconds.
Speaker 1 | 15:27
Okay? So you're just like ten and then immediately change the...
Speaker 2 | 15:30
Yeah, you want to do your compression right away. Now, if you are right there and it's a few steps away, I will grab the defibrillator. Yeah, put it on them because if I'm by myself, I'm going to put them out of first.
Yeah, because it's going to talk through it saying, "Now that's all downtime." Yeah, [Laughter].
Speaker 1 | 15:52
Each work.
Speaker 2 | 15:54
So, yeah, especially if you're whole or it's just do the compressions. You have somebody look at a lot of systems that you call that one, and they will say, "There's a different location, especially in stores in this part of the building."
So you have somebody to get that now. Would I run from here to the sanctuary? That's too far, so I would call them one to just do my compressions. That would just be too far. There is one right there.
Yeah, but I mean, it's that distance-wise, I might make that judgment call, but then again, if I'm circulating, they probably end up there. They'll be over shortly. Now there could be delayed. You just got that scenario. You got different scenarios. You just got to make your best judgment call away. I would if somebody collapsed right now myself, I would start compressing and call that one, and then I would be like, "Okay, it's been two minutes. I'm not getting anywhere. I might want to call and grab you." You can't, but that takes more of your energy, so that's hard.
Speaker 1 | 16:55
It's a child that's hard to do. And.
Speaker 2 | 16:57
Yeah, and hopefully, I think we run all but... Yeah.
Speaker 1 | 17:02
Hey, who you see, you know.
Speaker 2 | 17:05
But you're going to want to move like I was singing of different scenarios where it could be somebody in the choir goes down. We're not going to... If you think about it, we're going to move them. We're not
going to... So it's private moving the backstage now we've got even less move area to work. I would move them with the most room. So the call that love is gymnasiums and stuff like that because they have tons of room, but they always collapse into bathrooms or you got to get... Because you got...
