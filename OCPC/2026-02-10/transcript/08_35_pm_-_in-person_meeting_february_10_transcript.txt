Speaker 1 | 00:00
And with the deacons, it was Craig Granson and I over in the church there. And one of the guys says, I said, here, you know, Grandma sitting in the second pew went down, you know. So I said, we lay down on the ground here where we can work. Can't leave her on the pew in this side, you know, you got to figure out.
Speaker 2 | 00:20
And said.
Speaker 1 | 00:21
Cut. Suret he goes, Whoa, wait a second. We got 900 people sit in shirt. You're gonna cut her shirt off. I got. Well, I expect at that time, all the deacons and Els are going to come around this lady, you know, and we're going to make space. 
And we're going to make sure everything. You know you guys would.
Speaker 2 | 00:37
You are your people out at that time.
Speaker 1 | 00:40
It might be a good idea to stop things. Yes, because you've got too many people. You don't want to see this, but this gets.
Speaker 2 | 00:46
Yeah, it's just hopefully people self direct out. I mean, on Ocean Drive, everybody films, but nobody starts CPR that's. I'm saying, really not your problem. Your problem is trying to get somebody the pulse. They're not going to. I don't care if somebody sees me and I don't have a pulse. IPR [Laughter] the best you can.
Speaker 1 | 01:04
You got the team working on this and they're asking you guys take care of your jobs. You jump out of your seat and do what you gotta do. Hey, you go up there, we form a shield. We get everything. We make sure everything's going well.
Speaker 3 | 01:16
One thing and you are the experts like calling 911. You individually direct one person to do it.
Speaker 1 | 01:25
Yes.
Speaker 3 | 01:26
Like it like you're calling 911. Like, just point to one person, don't say somebody called nine.
Speaker 2 | 01:34
And you'll probably have other bystanders that will too. And then one of your special say is, all right, we have multiple calls. All right? Yeah. Or they'll say, like, tell us we have more. Like today we had a another fellow scaffolding and we have multiple calls of this guy's unconscious, blah. 
So then I'll just say, yeah, we'reware being up on you.
Speaker 4 | 01:51
And where? In the Sanctuary. Is the one.
Speaker 1 | 01:57
What can you see on this hold it up. Okay, now something else how do I know this has a good battery?
Speaker 2 | 02:08
No lights flash there.
Speaker 1 | 02:11
Green light flashes about every three four seconds. So if you're the deacon of the day or anyone else. I always just, you know, because I put these in here. I always come and I look. Well, see, the flash is good. 
And then I'll check to make sure the pads are there. And is there a charge?
Speaker 2 | 02:31
What batteries does it?
Speaker 1 | 02:34
It is special batteries.
Speaker 2 | 02:36
So we just replace you. They don't want to wait for them to die, they die. It gives you warnings and all that stuff.
Speaker 1 | 02:42
Yeah, I've got to, you know, buy constantly every other year by batteries.
Speaker 2 | 02:47
So is there any way for me to know how hard to push on this person? And so you want to get about and I he has a medican here. I have a high fidelity in my truck I could bring in that gives feedback to everyone.
Speaker 1 | 03:11
Yes.
Speaker 2 | 03:11
Yeah, but you have to the six year old or eighteen year old Ki like you're about 2". So you're about two inches. Weird to say. You've got to get the feel for it. I mean, you're gonna get rid of that nasty snapping of RISS. Let's wear your hand.
Speaker 1 | 03:37
It's doing the compression.
Speaker 2 | 03:42
Third show. If you're got too low, the design pointy process can snap that and you get a liver lack. But it's better than you probably.
Speaker 4 | 03:52
We good. So you don't want to break this lo. 
[Laughter] so it's this then you go a little bit higher.
Speaker 5 | 04:05
That's what I mean, try to break ris what I mean.
Speaker 2 | 04:08
That's literally happened to me a month ago.
Speaker 1 | 04:12
No, I passed all the dinner and your home.
Speaker 2 | 04:14
Wife and my wife was doing chestnuts.
Speaker 1 | 04:16
Did she break through? I hurt and.
Speaker 2 | 04:19
The EMS came, shaved my chest, put the things on. What was the problem?
Speaker 1 | 04:24
You know, it's spent.
Speaker 2 | 04:25
I spent a day.
Speaker 1 | 04:25
In the hospital. I don't know, like I said.
Speaker 2 | 04:32
So if you have the adult only pets and you have a pediatric, you can use them. You ro out of things so you can any your be pants and whatever. Either one of your minds to your hos spar or front back, I should say. 
And then they can support this. So if you forget, they'll spit and waste all that time until our. You guy don't waste all the time. Look at the there's pictures there like our guys should know better, but [Laughter] a lot of our. 
I mean, we have you guys too. So I said, as long as you get it on, it'll still send electricity through.
Speaker 1 | 05:04
Yes, and so what.
Speaker 2 | 05:06
Is it just size and dogs and kids? Yeah, you're you say the same amount it calculates your skin and tissue. Yes, it's different about entertain you.
Speaker 1 | 05:17
If you have to and you have nothing else. Yes.
Speaker 2 | 05:20
So what the machine is what the machine does is it calculates your what's called the impedance or your tissue it send as. So if you're using a pediatric pad, it's not going to be able to give you the adult dose that you need. 
But the reverse is not true. If you're using adult patter of the pediatric, it'll down its cause. It'll send an impedance on all your path and it'll down its jewels that it's sending through. So it is okay to do that. 
And you can push them back into wherever is. Now, what we're doing actually in a field is our first shop. We're doing like this. And our second shot, we're doing two defibrillators front and back. So we shot like that double peds dual sequential is what it's called. 
So it's getting in Palmach County does it now they're doing research on it, showing it's effective. We're not doing it because we don't always have a SE years here. So yeah, so anyway, you know me. But the pediatric an adult it's going to look pretty obvious it's not going to work. 
Maybe some of smalls, but it's not going to send your jewels that you need than nothing. And what do you do for a longer or does it do it for longer or the. What if you use a pediatric? If you use a pediatric as it's not going to generate the amount of electricity the pats can't produce the amount of. To overcome the impedance of your muscles in your skin. 
So you're not going to be able to get the full hold the dres actually, so it might work a skinny person it might work, but it's but that's you have it's better than nothing. But as I said, don't spend all your time on these, right? I'm not sure that's where he spent much time. 
That's why I see. They got away from a lot of airway stuff. First of all, people breathing. People worried about this doing a big mess, that's why. It's because they spend so much time. I don't know if that breath might let me revisit. 
And they get so focused on tasks that you don't get. The whole picture is they need the press too. Focused on pulse checks. Like ten seconds max. So if you don't feel it, start compressions. So and that's kind of the new thing, because it's not like even at the hospital. Now, if our newest tech doesn't feel, we just do compressions. 
So it's not like, well, then all the nurse checks, then the doctor checks, no, you don't feel it. We start compressions. One person says they don't feel it where there's two compressions because they still look like crap and are not doing anything. The worst we're going to do is we've already probably broken your ribs. Keep going for a little bit. 
And that's why it used to be you defibrillate and then you look at the rhythm and then you feel a pulse. What they found is, even if your heart starts on its own, it's just like a pup. It's not primed enough, so you need those compression to start priming that whole system. 
So that's why it's immediately back on the chest, doing compressions every time you stop for more than ten seconds. It's going to take about ten compressions to start getting that prime going and then continuing. 
So compressions is the king right now. So that's why they do that said ABC now it's C if you ever took CPR or your young it's now cav compressions, airwayne breathing. So, you know, obviously. And one other thing, if positioning. 
If they're unconscious, but they're breathing. So they talk about a breathing or ineffective breathing. So somebody because what will happen if you even if you lose a pulse. I've seen this happen where they're doing that. 
That's not effective breathing, so it's called. But we call guppy breathing in the field, so it's not effective breathing. So on those, I would still put the defibrillator up and you can start compressions on those. Now you know, it all gets into. 
Well, what if this kind of rate. If you think they look that sick. I just start compressions because that's ineffective breathing. So if they're taking a GAs every once in a while, that doesn't count. 
Like every ten seconds a GAs that doesn't count as good. You when you stop, when you when you've got to take it over. When else takes over. They say when you are completely exhausted, which being in an urban environment, probably not going to happen. 
But if you're by yourself and you are completely exhausted, that's it. Or they wake up until you get off their chest, which has happened. We've had that happen to patients where they're, you know, start waking up and fighting you. We got it back. 
And then sometimes will pull out their airway and they're fine. So it's still obviously up to the hospital. We have issues, but that does happen where they'll you'll get good you get a shock in compressions most of the time it does not early CPR and but it's still maybe 25% of those people are bress to get back. 
So it's not like you did anything wrong. If they still die, it's you defibriate. You can have the best tone ever and they'll still die. And then you can have one that you feel like everything goes wrong and then they live. 
So obviously it's not up to us, but we do. You do the best you can, but you dont expect to. Well, you know, we screwed up somewhere because they didn't make it. A lot of times they don't make it. So there's a lot of other scenarios you can put in there. 
If you know they can be vomiting. They can have this. Rescue can take care of that. Just compressions, right? If they start breathing on their own but they're still unconscious and it seem like effective breathing if you can roll under side, especially if they start vomiting and stuff, that helps keep the tongueel from sitting back and walking. Airway. By then you should have a lot more help there, so don't worry about too. 
I mean, Ed Sho is your doctor, so I'm sure he'll come in and help, but, you know, we have enough people and they're close by, but they could be on the call, so you could be running it for a little bit.
Speaker 1 | 11:03
So a lot of nurses.
Speaker 2 | 11:06
And everybody's going to have an opinion. That's a thing. So everybody should be on the same page of you needed your compressions.
Speaker 1 | 11:12
But we should always be one person in charge.
Speaker 2 | 11:16
Call.
Speaker 1 | 11:17
Call the shots is first. That just helps.
Speaker 6 | 11:22
I think for us a matter. Well, we know so many stands before the beacon, it's good to know where it is. Check the battery that you mentioned. I fort about that.
Speaker 1 | 11:31
One machine is right in the office here in the corner of the box, it says AD. Pretty easy to see it. They took a little whistle off of it, you know, because if you open it up, it's supposed to make a noise that's gone anyway. 
And then the other one is on the People's Desk in there.
Speaker 2 | 11:49
Desk go to the closet. The closet there. Correct? Whoever's the.
Speaker 4 | 11:55
That's true.
Speaker 1 | 11:55
And I come off the Desk in the last six months.
Speaker 6 | 11:59
And be aware more stuff on that. Yes, we have. You can't use a bunch of stuff first. So I don't think that you have to go. This is not the only thing that that's next.
Speaker 2 | 12:12
Next time we're going to get cut and we're gonna try to bandage.
Speaker 1 | 12:16
The training. Chest. So I know where it is and goes by. Even though I know where it is in the closet. But that's for terms.
Speaker 2 | 12:30
Tonight is brown, that's.
Speaker 4 | 12:36
Red.
Speaker 3 | 12:40
People that are opening up bleed bags and knowing how to do stop the bleed is totally different. Yes, it's a totally.
Speaker 4 | 12:49
Thank you, Rick. Thank you, Jason. Appreciate you guys coming out here one and did one last thing and this kind of goes for will and Ephraim. You guys can speak to this. The balcony in the excuse me, the closet in the balcony was cleaned out. The closet and the balcony theres one of them was cleaned out, apparently was so right. 
But there's stuff to take to the there's stuff to take to the dumpster. And I guess Doug is going to take it today, but he can't take everything. So we could just get a couple guys to take everything. 
And then for you guys, if you don't mind, just, like, go and take a look. Make sure we're not a dumpster here. Yeah, our dumpster. But just make sure that we're not throwing something where we shouldn't. Or if there's something in there that needs to get thrown away that we can do. 
So just after this, if you guys go over there, who's.
Speaker 2 | 13:38
Who's taking that who's take that. Who will will's got it whoever.
Speaker 4 | 13:42
Whoever can. Dal if you closed in prayer. Sure. Please.
Speaker 5 | 13:48
Heavenly Father, thank you for being with us during this meeting tonight. Pray that we can maintain the knowledge that we learned here about CPR and we pray that you watch over this church, watch over the congregation. We pray that we don't have to do that, but we know that might end up happening. 
So we pray your blessing on all the deacons and who just heard that. May it stick with us. Thank you for this meeting, Lord. Please help us as we try to do our best in all these various tasks that we just went over, and may we do it for your glory in Jesus. Nam am.
