Speaker 1 | 00:00
It is a very dependent...
Speaker 2 | 00:02
Like my daughter was...
Speaker 3 | 00:03
A person. All right.
Speaker 1 | 00:06
Yeah, you know my guys, go ahead and get started. You just gave me an email out, right? Yeah, it was last night. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and get started now. Chris, would you open up with her, please?
Speaker 4 | 00:28
Thank you for bringing us all together here tonight to discuss church information and what we might do as deacons. Bless all these...
Speaker 3 | 00:36
Men that are here...
Speaker 5 | 00:37
And are working.
Speaker 3 | 00:42
So we're blessed.
Speaker 4 | 00:44
That we can do...
Speaker 6 | 00:44
This...
Speaker 1 | 00:45
First things first, did anyone look at the minutes from the last meeting and are they approved? Yeah, yes, awesome, thank you. Moving on to upcoming events. So we are just still pending the fellowship event that we're going to have.
So just be on the lookout for once that date is set next week or the week, I guess not this weekend. The following weekend, Mission's Week will start, so there is the men's prayer breakfast on that Saturday morning. I don't think we have to do anything for setup or anything, but obviously we just want to encourage everybody to attend.
I think it's from 8 to 10. Then the next day, Sunday, is going to be like the kickoff breakfast for the whole church there. We likely will have to do something. I'm not sure exactly what yet. Maria Ramirez is going to let me know.
So I don't know if it'll be similar to the beginning of this year for the Sunday school classes. I don't know if it'll be like that. But we have to get there and help with cooking or if it will just be set up or just clean up as soon as I hear, I will pass it along.
I feel like we've done those kinds of things enough where you have a good system in place and don't really need everybody there. So whoever we can get obviously will be good. Any questions on either of those? The picnic is supposed to be as of right now, March 29th. I was hoping while he was going to be here because I know he was going to call Eric.
So I will reach out to him just to verify that Eric and Sports Girl will be able to do the 29th because that date is pending on Sports to be able to help. If they can't, then it'll be pushed to the 19th, I think so it would be, as of right now, supposed to be the week before Easter.
If it can't be, then it'll be pushed to two weeks after Easter. So I'll confirm with Wally that he was able to get in touch with ARO. I am... Yeah. So for next month's meeting, we'll definitely know when it's going to be and so we can talk more details and everything, but it's going to be more or less the same as it's been in the past. We'll need as many tents as we can get for whoever can bring those. I don't know if it'll be the same number of rides and games for the kids as the last one, but we'll have the same set up with chairs and tables and everything.
Keep an eye on the forecast. So we can audible like we did last time and cover the tables and do whatever. So next month's meeting, we'll talk more. Look back at our notes from the previous picnic, too, to see things that we could do better.
Speaker 2 | 03:45
So don't put that table out in the thing in case it rains.
Speaker 1 | 03:49
Yeah, exactly. We'll definitely be monitoring the weather closely. So Sports Girl helps us with all the cooking of the burgers and the dogs and the corn and gentlemen. Okay.
Speaker 7 | 04:18
So more corn.
Speaker 1 | 04:21
Okay, yeah. Short work.
Speaker 6 | 04:27
Typically, you have a number you think it's going to be.
Speaker 1 | 04:41
That's right. I mean, I assume Dina places the order so...
Speaker 8 | 04:46
We have the counts from...
Speaker 1 | 04:47
Last time we did... Okay, yeah, okay, I thought Tyrone did... We broke the corner. We did in half. Yeah, okay.
Speaker 4 | 05:14
Cool.
Speaker 1 | 05:17
So, yes, so it's basically a Sunday that Sports World is able to help, and it would normally be the Sunday after Easter, but there's like the Palmetto Bay seafood test or something like that going on for fourteen.
Yeah, exactly, so, they're going to be working that so they can't do that Sunday, so that's why it's going to be either the 19th or hopefully the 29th of March instead. Thanks. Any other questions or anything about that?
Speaker 4 | 05:48
Any of us come out if we had to?
Speaker 1 | 05:56
Yeah. I mean...
Speaker 7 | 05:57
If we had to, we could use that grill or we use the men's event. That was quite big. We have a big five and five-foot flattop, and we have a five-foot grill, but that's a lot of cooking. Yeah, they're much better at it.
Speaker 1 | 06:11
Doug's the one to talk to you about it.
Speaker 7 | 06:13
Yeah, that's as they make it look easy.
Speaker 8 | 06:17
No, we used to cook, and it's difficult.
Speaker 1 | 06:20
For the men's... It's like... Yeah, [Laughter].
Speaker 4 | 06:24
What I used to do... My grandpa all the time events.
Speaker 7 | 06:28
Yeah. It's too... I mean, it's doable, but it's...
Speaker 4 | 06:32
Yeah, [Laughter].
Speaker 7 | 06:38
You put it in the fridge, and it was stacked [Laughter].
Speaker 4 | 06:47
Memory.
Speaker 9 | 06:54
And as good usually good like camp like works is a seafood fest like before.
Speaker 1 | 06:59
After, right? And that's true. The ROS.
Speaker 9 | 07:02
Have got down the sides.
Speaker 1 | 07:04
For sure.
Speaker 4 | 07:05
As a backup to the...
Speaker 1 | 07:07
I would do yes, know Wally was going to help you if you need to, but I haven't talked to him yet to see him.
Speaker 9 | 07:16
Text.
Speaker 1 | 07:17
Okay, yeah, once... Yeah, I'll talk to Wally and then I'll let you know. Well, awesome. So yeah, so next week or next month we'll talk more about just more details about the picnic the week after. Hopefully, the week after the picnic will be Easter, so there are going to be two services. I don't remember what time they are. I assume 9:00 and 10:30, if I had to guess. I don't know if anybody remembers 9:11.
Okay, but there are going to be two services we are going to need to... Usher would expect it to be a lot like Christmas Eve and the Christmas concert in terms of the number of people. I imagine that we'll have to do a lot with parking as well. Good news is there won't be snow, so we don't have to worry about blocking out part of the parking lot for the kids.
I will add as to the WhatsApp, which first of all, shout out to WhatsApp. Thank you guys for all joining. Hopefully, that's working smoother than the group you was, but we'll put the events in WhatsApp so we can make sure that we have enough coverage for ushering for both services. Awesome.
Yeah, that's you get me already, that's good. Yeah, right. Glad to get out. I just hang out in the group. I miss it. On the ushering... Now, I did hear from Dina a week or two ago that we are doing a great job, so keep it up.
Yeah, I was... I was surprised that...
Speaker 7 | 08:44
She got mad at me this Sunday [Laughter].
Speaker 1 | 08:49
High price.
Speaker 10 | 08:50
Called.
Speaker 4 | 08:51
Easter event.
Speaker 10 | 08:54
Do we have enough of the best for the traffic control people? Safety vs whatever the orange or yellow?
Speaker 1 | 09:03
Yeah, I know we have a few in the closet there. I don't remember exactly how many it is. Should be enough because I think everybody who was out in the parking lot for the Christmas concert Christmas Eve had one.
So yeah. If anything, if we don't... We have our usher tags and stuff, so we can look somewhat official out there as far as parking goes. I'll double-check and see how many are there and can ask Dean, Doug, or someone to get more if we need.
So just keep an eye out for signing up for ushering. Any questions on Easter?
Ministry coordinator updates. Tyrone and Jonathan stuff you...
Speaker 3 | 09:55
So kitchen got news no.
Speaker 10 | 09:58
They're in.
Speaker 3 | 10:00
Yard core dark. I sang a chat a few minutes ago to email update from Victor, so I was going through it. There are a few... It's called what we call a change order. It's... It's what contractors do.
There's more work to be done. So when the structure engineer came by...
Speaker 6 | 10:27
To see the pictures.
Speaker 3 | 10:28
That I... The base of the tower is cracked. It has to be replaced. You can't put a towel on that and Dakota anymore. So that's one of the things that caused a change order material permit 8800 books.
The other change was electrical upgrades and electrical overbrakes are to all the disconnects that you see there are all corroded. It is not going to pass... The way it is... Honestly, now, I don't know how we haven't got caught by the county or anything.
So you see those pictures? You see the honduous cor streets of bare metal work, exposed water. There's another. So that's 220.
Speaker 6 | 11:33
Holes. So if it sparks, it can be some money.
Speaker 3 | 11:37
But there are some other things that have to be done. For example, they have to put that increasing average of 30-30 as per tower. They're currently 20. So a big power of 30.
I already said it to him and he's like, "I didn't do it cheaper. You just... I'll have to meet up Landry on Monday or Tuesday next week. He's to be certain that I think he has a family member as a nutrition as well. To see if you can come out and give you that qual."
But if we have to go with it, it will be $9,000. So the addition of mechanical and structure is an extra $20,100 on top of everything. So everything went from $194,000 to $200,150. I remember. So we're still within the range and this is fixing everything.
Speaker 10 | 13:03
Fixing the platform electrical purpose and it's fixing the fla.
Speaker 3 | 13:13
No, it's not replacing and replacing. Yeah. There's no fixing. I don't know if we saw there. Yes, that's... There's no fixing. He said that we GA.
Speaker 10 | 13:21
Me so that's for both platforms.
Speaker 3 | 13:23
For both things. He said once we...
Speaker 10 | 13:29
Give him the okay.
Speaker 3 | 13:30
If we're going to use his vendors as his guys are going there, he said they could restart a date to remove a date to make a platform to do everything. I'm just trying to bring my guys to see them become a little bit cheaper to help us out.
I'm someone in the family of fishing too. Let me... I'll set up a dog or C1 will come in and... But the only thing is that we have to have a license for hars.
Every day. If I can't call. Do I always call Doug? Doug meets up with him and takes him around. Other than that, they said that they got everything on their permits back. All of this is just... Let us know when if we want to pay this $21. They say that they could just get the permits, get everything in. They'll give us the D's actually move and install.
Speaker 4 | 14:33
But that's the thing, though. You pull permits. I mean the $21 has the permits and all of the connections that other people have navigated the county. So to consider... So you got to factor that into...
Speaker 10 | 14:48
So do they... So if you get somebody from the outside of electricity...
Speaker 3 | 14:52
They would have to pull them. We give it to him Rees, and they certify. Okay, yeah, it's their job. It's already done, and they'll take out the change. He's just... They're sewing so they put 20% on the top. Yeah, minimum, so it's sales high so that company selling out they're going to make up.
Speaker 6 | 15:31
No, exactly.
Speaker 3 | 15:32
So I guess some folks... I don't know structural engineering that would do that. I'm going to spread... Do the platform maybe that's the route that we're going to have to go with them because I don't know you have that more specific than just electricity that's something you really...
Speaker 7 | 16:00
I just stay with the guy.
Speaker 4 | 16:03
Don't worry about it, go with...
Speaker 1 | 16:04
The cost quote. That's what I'm trying to piecemeal it.
Speaker 7 | 16:08
Yeah, throw money at the problem is like...
Speaker 11 | 16:12
Yeah.
Speaker 10 | 16:14
Well, I think it's probably opposite session maybe.
Speaker 7 | 16:17
I don't know. I was going to session.
Speaker 8 | 16:18
Why did just...
Speaker 1 | 16:19
Approve.
Speaker 3 | 16:19
The money? We can't make recommendations.
It has to move.
Speaker 6 | 16:36
Move and replace and demolition done years ago.
Speaker 7 | 16:46
What's your opinion? Should we try to piecemeal this, or do we just go with a quote and eat the little bit of the...?
Speaker 3 | 16:51
The easiest way to quote...
Speaker 2 | 16:53
Yeah, because what are we talking about? A thousand bucks difference. Have you found...? That's what I'm saying is you review with... If you got quotes from other... I don't know what you're really going to save this way.
Speaker 1 | 17:06
Cool breezes.
Speaker 7 | 17:10
Yeah, I would say yeah.
Speaker 1 | 17:12
It's just they're over everything something.
Speaker 8 | 17:15
No, I understand. So a quick...
Speaker 7 | 17:16
Vote we could do.
Speaker 8 | 17:17
This... Who thinks we should just go with what we have, or who wants to...? We do have the number, but listen, this is my point. Do we think we're going to...? Because I think there is a time for us to do this. Summer is coming, and it's going to get hot, and it's better to get this done.
Speaker 7 | 17:34
As soon as a penny wise pound foolish, right?
Speaker 10 | 17:38
Ourselves. What would be a number? We would say, "Okay, no, maybe we should piece it out."
Speaker 1 | 17:42
I mean, it's ten K.
Speaker 10 | 17:44
Thousand dollars, so it's...
Speaker 8 | 17:49
I'm saying it's a $200,000 job. They've added $20,000 to it in change orders.
Speaker 1 | 17:54
And we do have an already within our budget.
Speaker 8 | 17:58
We are trying to be good stewards of the money of the church. I understand that. It's just... That's why I said we could vote on it, isn't it? Who wants to spend another week looking at that? See if we can say $5,000, or do we just say, "Well, go forward with it. Let's just get it done."
Speaker 1 | 18:14
Yeah, so all in favor of the quote as is from Quo's all in favor of opposed a unanimous it's. Yeah, I feel like if something goes wrong, it's there, then it's all in one person's hands. [Laughter].
Speaker 7 | 18:38
Tell him that when you sign it. [Laughter].
Speaker 1 | 18:41
Appreciate you.
Speaker 7 | 18:43
Yeah, thank you for exploring it. Yeah, for the actual install. I mean...
Speaker 12 | 18:51
Obviously, it's going to take more time, but how long is this going to be? Is there a week?
Speaker 3 | 18:55
We're not going to have a seat SLA, so now it's amazing. I was talking to Victor about the same for the demo there. There are two things that we can do. They can add support like Jack, not Jack, who was trained on what I call the trains, the railroads, and Jack up the tower put that in demo all the concrete.
Speaker 6 | 19:26
Okay.
Speaker 3 | 19:28
And then plan and on the same age. This can be between two days of the... We see it can be dropped through a week maybe or Wednesday.
Speaker 6 | 19:36
Thursday or...
Speaker 3 | 19:38
It is... They don't use it.
Speaker 4 | 19:40
They take out.
Speaker 3 | 19:41
The units.
Speaker 6 | 19:42
Bring Crane, the new ones in there.
Speaker 3 | 19:45
And once the news that's...
Speaker 4 | 19:49
So BS comes in on Wednesdays, they're going to do a huge thing. So it would have to be either Thursday, Friday, up by Sunday, or literally start a demo Sunday service.
Speaker 10 | 20:05
How unlikeliness is it that you can't be the same?
Speaker 4 | 20:08
Right? That's.
Speaker 7 | 20:11
That's another...
Speaker 11 | 20:15
It has happened, and I served as an administrative leader. As long as you've given enough time, then we say, "Okay, that way because this... We're going to go... Yeah." Then you have that power.
Speaker 4 | 20:27
And get everything done.
Speaker 11 | 20:28
Because it will be more impactful if we TED to do it.
Speaker 1 | 20:33
Or.
You can do that for.
Speaker 10 | 20:44
For the summer or up the whole way that...
Speaker 3 | 20:48
I was talking to the gentleman about home briefs, and he says all we had to do was approve the change order, and it's included in whatever that... So we paid.
Speaker 6 | 20:59
50%.
Speaker 3 | 21:00
And it's the next 7% of.
Speaker 1 | 21:06
I like...
Speaker 7 | 21:16
Don't tell him we voted unanimously to accept it. Listen, all voted yes, but...
Speaker 6 | 21:26
We, you know.
Speaker 7 | 21:26
There's no tax.
Speaker 1 | 21:27
There are no taxes on that.
Speaker 7 | 21:28
We did not get a grant.
Speaker 1 | 21:31
C3, no taxes.
Can I do 19 now? Thanks again for staying. Thank you, John. No, that's encouraging.
Speaker 3 | 21:53
Really encouraging.
Speaker 8 | 21:54
Well when do you move Jonathan? Yeah when are you moving.
Speaker 3 | 22:06
Where are you going?
Speaker 1 | 22:11
A little bit of a commute for you.
Speaker 3 | 22:18
Now my dad's the people those so...
Speaker 1 | 22:27
Well, great job. For the termites, we did send the quote right to the session to Dina, right? Okay, just right, which they're not meeting.
Speaker 7 | 22:47
Right? Okay, so I don't know if I caught that we... Dina has the quote, and Adam is going to present it to the team.
Speaker 1 | 22:53
Quote, I guess so, yeah.
Speaker 4 | 22:56
Okay, you...
Speaker 7 | 22:57
Adam or so someone will present.
Speaker 1 | 23:00
The determine social 90-something. We voted last time. Just a recap. We voted last time to go with Terminus, 90 terminated.
Speaker 4 | 23:11
The second course.
Speaker 1 | 23:12
Yeah, it's half the gay tough. Yeah.
Speaker 4 | 23:20
I was six months. As you said last time, it was the quote.
Speaker 1 | 23:24
So... Yeah, so, but Dina has it, so she'll communicate if we need to go present it before the session and everything, but...
Speaker 7 | 23:31
Yeah, Das India's hands.
Speaker 1 | 23:33
I think you got pushed to the next week.
Speaker 3 | 23:37
So that brings us to...
Speaker 6 | 23:39
The roofing thing.
Speaker 3 | 23:39
I was actually going to go to that meeting.
Speaker 6 | 23:47
An update. He's just... He's kind of taking the lead on this just because of his background and just... [Laughter] I always let the expert in the lead, right? But anyhow, so we do have a structural engineer that's working on this. He hasn't, to my knowledge, presented anything yet, but it sounds like it's going to be something along the lines of cutting those flush and putting some kind of metal support from the roof line back some distance. Been doing it for 30 years, and he's familiar with this kind of architecture.
Speaker 1 | 24:26
Cutting all of them shorter, only the ones that have fallen.
Speaker 10 | 24:28
They're all falling, they're all bad horr.
Speaker 6 | 24:34
His recommendation is to lower the drainage in the guns, to lower them so that they're not...
Speaker 3 | 24:44
Able to do that again. In other words, put much need to be.
Speaker 6 | 24:47
In such a way, right? That job is going to be for another contractor, probably the fourth generation Robert. He's familiar with that stuff.
Speaker 3 | 25:01
And it's not.
Speaker 6 | 25:02
Likely we'll be able to sell that copper when we've got to go that far into replacement. Copper is expensive. This engineer suggests to keep with copper. It's got longevity. It'll last another...
Speaker 10 | 25:16
50 years in much...
Speaker 6 | 25:20
But it will.
Speaker 3 | 25:21
It will like push the ticket above RK.
Speaker 10 | 25:27
To redo them to...
Speaker 6 | 25:30
You can't do...
Speaker 1 | 25:38
I mean, Molly took what fell off the other. You know, we talk about.
Speaker 10 | 25:50
We use the same...
Speaker 6 | 25:52
Because you're going to be ticketing it all down.
Speaker 3 | 25:55
You need to be...
Speaker 6 | 25:56
One seamless price and there's probably some dics there as well.
Speaker 3 | 26:00
I don't know.
Speaker 6 | 26:01
How you can sell it.
Speaker 5 | 26:03
I don't know the answer.
Speaker 10 | 26:09
The last more than... That was really good. But...
Speaker 6 | 26:18
The copper's already proven so it's already been...
Speaker 10 | 26:20
You know, I get it's very expensive, but like in a book, for example, that's salt water just fine and stainless.
Speaker 1 | 26:27
Same conference... So we'll know more after you and... Okay, so that was... Okay, so for the next meeting of our next meetings. Okay, so we should have confirmation on that and the term.
Speaker 6 | 26:53
This gentleman seems to know his stuff, you know, walk. We walked around for a good hour, pull around, look at it, and get them. I'm not a structural engineer. I'm not an engineer, so it's nice to have...
Speaker 3 | 27:07
There because he asked.
Speaker 6 | 27:08
All those direct questions that are hard, that are hearing that gets you to commit. He was out here too when we had Rob Nielsen out there.
Speaker 3 | 27:16
And he was.
Speaker 6 | 27:17
He's a good sales guy. He could... Send the shirt off your back is that good, right? But we asked the hard questions as your structural engineer signed off on this and this. You couldn't ask that question. Doug, on the other hand, is the other engineer. He says, "Yes, we can do this.
I've already been with plans and he...
Real closely." You did ask this question, which I didn't know the answer to you, but we had our 40-year inspection.
Speaker 7 | 27:57
Don't comments in the peanut gallery.
Clearly.
Speaker 6 | 28:19
Yeah, still that doesn't mean that this building issues.
Speaker 3 | 28:24
I'm in the wrong line. 40.
Speaker 1 | 28:29
Anything else for you? Right now, facilities. So...
Speaker 6 | 28:33
Yeah, the pews, right? Okay, yeah, need help. He was trying to repair one of the pieces a few weeks ago, and he was already there. He got stuck. His back went out. He couldn't get up in the hours he was... He was basically straight, so he says, "I can't do that."
Speaker 7 | 28:53
My gosh.
Speaker 6 | 28:54
So we all... It is just take two by fours. He's going to cut him up, he's going to do the measuring. He can't cut him up. He just... Me as a couple of those guys.
Speaker 4 | 29:06
And that's so what we'll do for that. I talked to him. I ran into him at drop off one day... Afraid of Mike. You said something, and there's somebody else who wasn't Joe from what? Yeah, Effran actually... No, he lives so far away. Joe brought it up too. What will come out and give Doug and just get the... Here's what we need to do.
Then whenever he needs it, it'll reach out to you, and you just say, "Hey, guys, Joe."
Speaker 6 | 29:43
Let's go.
Speaker 7 | 29:45
And what is it that you're doing? It's adding like it's a legy.
Speaker 4 | 29:50
Is it just a support beam? Because it kind of sag. Yeah's certain point.
Speaker 6 | 29:56
We have very...
Speaker 5 | 29:59
So...
Speaker 6 | 30:04
It fits them in there and...
Speaker 7 | 30:08
It's like a band-aid.
Speaker 4 | 30:10
Yeah, so... But there's so much more that goes to that, like the liability and that was what... Not, but we were talking about it. Let's go see the way Doug has it, what he wants. Then if we decide that we need to do it differently, we will.
Then what? Three guys at least that know what to do so we can all sync up to solve it. Keep going.
Speaker 11 | 30:40
I think the underlying issue is not going to go away. We don't have the budget, and it's not in the short-term plan to try to replace everything. So the idea is that if we have... These are the steps. Then recruit because it's going to continue to happen.
The liability that there has been so many that they are to the point of going to break. Then I'll be another...
Speaker 10 | 31:02
I'm thinking that way, too. We fix the ones that are broken, and we fix them as they break, but I don't think we should wait until they break. Well, we need to make an effort to say... Okay. Now these all have to be reinforced.
If something were to happen, you were trying to fix the problem. But if you knowingly know the problem and wait for something to happen...
Speaker 11 | 31:24
Well, the thing is that this is why they review the minutes [Laughter] and try to measure them. So the mechanism is that every time someone complains, they go to the dog or they go to the front. It's like, "Hey, this sounds weird.
It is about to break." That's the only alarm that we get right now. So he's going to try his best to monitor. If there's something that looks weird, try to give us a heads-up.
Speaker 10 | 31:56
Before it's too late. That's what I'm saying. We do all that and when we're done with that or we get to do finish all that before we replace or whatever, we continue to do the ones that we think are at least... We're trying this ongoing.
Speaker 7 | 32:11
Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 6 | 32:11
Tara, this up. I brought it up to a couple of people, and him and I have a meeting, so this facility needs a lot of attention, a lot of baseball.
Speaker 7 | 32:26
Yep.
Speaker 6 | 32:30
A closet where they park all the stuff that's in this building. We don't have an office. There's what office or SS on camp, not a real office. I think the only office that there was is now taken home by the new Assor.
So we just cleared out those rooms upstairs right recently that ended up being used. So I recommended that we commandeer one of those make it office.
Speaker 3 | 33:06
All these discrepancies.
Speaker 6 | 33:07
And all of these things that are happening.
Speaker 3 | 33:09
And how.
Speaker 6 | 33:09
To keep track of it, like you said, because we're not taking action, just ignoring it. And something does happen. Somebody's going to miss it. Someone's going to play as before about this. Yeah, I think we have to have a stronger focus on the facilities, and the reality is Doug is overworked. You can't do all this stuff.
Speaker 7 | 33:34
This is Doug Simpson.
Speaker 9 | 33:38
I think it's a long time coming. It's coming, and it's interesting.
Speaker 6 | 33:54
Get into the, you know, second phase of the ACS workshop.
Speaker 1 | 33:59
We have one. Yeah.
Speaker 6 | 34:04
Denial about that. He said to someone else, and I'm like, I don't think so. You know, I don't think they're going to pass the inspection.
Speaker 4 | 34:12
I mean, the session is putting together all these committees, and one that's coming eventually is technology. Mark and I've talked about it at the time like we have a Mac many upstairs that is used every other Sunday basically, but just have some sort of documentation because we talk about it with the audio stuff like there's been till Tony got here, there are two people that knew what's going on, and it just disappears. The institutional knowledge is gone.
So we can start implementing that you can use the computer that's up there. We did whatever to keep track of it. It's a really nice computer.
Speaker 3 | 35:02
Says no.
Speaker 1 | 35:04
I think that's a good it's a good suggestion. So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mix.
Yeah, for sure.
Speaker 3 | 35:22
Yeah. I think maybe having someone... I don't know what how much it will cost, but have maybe someone help them out like labor.
Speaker 12 | 35:35
At this point, we've hired labor. We're probably hiring replacements as well.
Speaker 9 | 35:40
So that's because I think those discussions are internal because he's been planning on retiring over the last few years. And it's just little things, healthcare and things like that. So that's pretty up.
So I think it's close.
I think it's a great idea that's a separate area.
Speaker 1 | 36:04
For...
Speaker 5 | 36:04
For me.
Speaker 9 | 36:10
That's not...
Speaker 1 | 36:14
I do want to keep us moving. One additional thing, and I know we did talk about this a few months ago in regards to the youth building. So obviously you guys know Eric, he's now the youth pastor, and he did mention a few items that we did talk about that he wanted to see if he could get some of us to help him out with. One being just taking a couch to the dump. One being fixing a couple of electrical outlets, which I know we have that they looked at or something like that. Fixing some of the boards, the base boards. I guess he was probably going to try to find a time that works for him, send it to us so that we can get as many guys there to work with him to tackle them all.
So just again, keep an eye out for that and I'll send the invite as soon as I hear from him. But just a few things that we already were aware of in the youth building. But now he's to take an initiative to get them taken care of.
So any questions on that?
Speaker 4 | 37:14
Only the assessment of the moisture stuff, but I was talking to about it with the AC, it was pump the brakes on that a little bit.
Speaker 1 | 37:24
Okay, you just... Which I'm happy to... Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
Speaker 4 | 37:28
It's a free assessment.
Speaker 1 | 37:29
Yeah, I mean, I don't yeah, I don't know. I mean.
Speaker 11 | 37:34
A little chance against...
Speaker 12 | 37:38
May not be worth...
Speaker 4 | 37:40
Yeah, because I would assess it for free, but it's a remediation that...
Speaker 1 | 37:48
We'll wait to hear more from Eric and when we can jump over there. Do you want to move on to. Yes, NRCY Ministry and care portal and kind of talk about like transition starting to transition some stuff off of Steve's plate.
Yeah.
Speaker 9 | 38:05
After...
You guys in the future do serve a couple of goals, and one of them is the...
Something that means a lot to me that I worked with her for many years, and there are several of you guys just doing it. All you guys could do. Been active with in the last year or so.
It's really stood out.
Speaker 5 | 39:15
I thought...
Speaker 9 | 39:16
It would be an excellent fit for the chairing.
Speaker 5 | 39:20
Of this.
Speaker 9 | 39:20
This fund. I'm going to nominate him to be chairman of the committee, and I've spoken with him this week about it because he's accepted. So with your blessing and a majority vote.
Speaker 5 | 39:40
I think it will be all right.
Speaker 7 | 39:44
So, yeah, what we're voting on is to make Mike Tunez, the chairman of the Mercy Ministry, take over the responsibilities for...
Speaker 9 | 39:55
So just to clarify, a committee oversees the fund. The fund is there to help individuals in our church, families in our church, and actually outside the church as well, apply to the fund for assistance.
When we consider these requests as a committee... So that's the table. So that's what I would like to do is just nominate them and show hands.
Speaker 1 | 40:26
All in favor, all opposed.
Speaker 7 | 40:31
No unanimous vote.
Speaker 9 | 40:34
We're showing ropes and things happen. We're a long way.
Speaker 5 | 40:37
And.
The fund and you know.
Speaker 9 | 40:56
The fund puts money into a lot of these requests here. So it's cost.
Speaker 1 | 41:07
And as far as hurricane preparedness, are you don't want to be like involved in that. I think that extends past the DA.
Speaker 9 | 41:14
I'm definitely interested in continuing that. Okay, summertime, I can still be with you guys.
Speaker 1 | 41:20
I don't have a problem with...
Speaker 7 | 41:23
You got a pretty good track record of no hurricane. That's true.
Speaker 1 | 41:27
Yeah, as long as there's no storm.
Speaker 7 | 41:31
Yeah.
Speaker 3 | 41:32
He kept up... [Laughter] Both.
Speaker 1 | 41:35
Thank you so much, Steve, for your services and all that. Thank you, Mike, for being willing to step up. Definitely don't want to keep our next guest waiting any longer. But Rick has been kind enough to join us.
Then Jason, obviously being one of our deacons as well, to just talk about CPR and Florida to play a little, but not much.
Speaker 6 | 42:01
I know what these are.
Speaker 8 | 42:06
The thing I can't say.
