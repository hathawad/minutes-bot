## 4. Ministry Coordinator Updates

### A. Facilities — Tyrone Shire & Jonathan Colon

#### Cooling Tower / A/C Replacement

**Change Order #1 from Cool-Breeze Air Conditioning (Victor Henao, dated 02/05/26):**

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Original contract amount | $194,900.00 |
| Structural design, wind load calculations & drawings | $1,450.00 |
| Structural work, materials & permit | $8,850.00 |
| Electrical upgrades & permit | $9,800.00 |
| **Change order total** | **$20,100.00** |
| **Revised contract amount** | **$215,000.00** |

**Structural findings:**
- Base of cooling tower is cracked — cannot support new tower; must be replaced
- Four (4) new hot-dipped steel I-beams and engineer-specified anchors required
- Existing concrete crack must be patched

**Electrical findings:**
- All electrical disconnect boxes and conduits are heavily corroded (photos shared)
- Bare metal/wiring exposed to water — would not pass county inspection
- Circuits must be increased from 20 amps to 30 amps per tower
- Electrical scope: two (2) new NEMA 3, 30-amp disconnects for water pumps; two (2) new NEMA 3, 60-amp disconnects for cooling towers; reworking electrical piping for sprinkler system

**Other updates:**
- Mechanical and electrical plans completed by Francisco Garcia and Associates
- Permit application in process; Notice of Commencement submitted
- A/C equipment delayed due to weather — estimated arrival in Miami **02/13/26**
- Demolition and crane dates TBD; demo estimated 2–3 days
- Chemical water treatment system recommended for new cooling tower
- Jonathan exploring whether a family contact (electrician) could provide a cheaper quote, but group consensus was to stay with Cool-Breeze to avoid piecemealing

**Discussion:**
- Still within approved budget range
- Concern about delaying with summer approaching
- Having one contractor handle everything provides single point of accountability
- No sales tax (501(c)(3) status)

**Decision:** Unanimously approved Change Order #1 ($20,100) — proceed with Cool-Breeze for full scope including structural and electrical work.

**Payment:** 50% already paid on original contract; next payment at 70% milestone.

#### Termite Treatment

- Terminix quote ($98,764) approved at last meeting
- Quote has been sent to Session / Dina for final approval
- **Action Item:** Dina to present to Session for approval

#### Sanctuary Roof Beam Repairs

- Structural engineer has been assessing the situation (connected through Michael Capote)
- Engineer walked the property for over an hour, appears very knowledgeable
- **Preliminary recommendation:**
  - Cut deteriorated beam ends flush
  - Install metal supports from roof line
  - Lower the drainage/gutters so they cannot collect water and cause rot again
- Contractor: Fourth Generation Roofers (Robert) — familiar with this architecture
- Engineer recommends keeping copper material for gutters (longevity: 50+ years)
  - Copper is expensive but proven at this location
  - May be able to sell salvaged copper to offset cost
- Engineer has not yet presented formal plans — more details expected by next meeting
- Rob Nielsen (sales rep from earlier assessment) was also present; engineer asked the hard structural questions

#### Pews

- Doug Simpson attempted repair on a pew, threw out his back — cannot continue alone
- Plan: Cut 2x4 supports to reinforce sagging pews; Doug S. will do measuring/cutting
- **Volunteers to help:** Chris Lilburn, Joe (from church), Efrain, Mike
- **Coordinator:** Will Walker — will assess with Doug Simpson first, then schedule work day
- Longer-term: Pew replacement not in current budget; will reinforce and monitor
  - Track complaints and proactively check for failing pews to address before breakage

#### Youth Building

- Eric Benk (youth pastor) has a few items he'd like help with:
  - Remove a couch (take to dump)
  - Fix electrical outlets
  - Repair baseboards
- Eric to send a date; Adam will forward invite to group
- Moisture assessment on hold — free assessment available but remediation would be costly; waiting for more input from Eric

#### Facilities General Discussion

- Tyrone raised concern that Doug Simpson is overworked and facility needs more structured attention
- **Suggestion:** Commandeer one of the recently cleared upstairs rooms as a facilities office
  - Centralize documentation, work orders, and tracking
  - Use existing iMac computer upstairs for record-keeping
- Discussion about institutional knowledge being lost when people leave — need better documentation
- Discussion about potentially hiring labor help or planning for Doug S.'s eventual retirement
- Technology committee forming (Mark and others) — could help with documentation systems

### B. Mercy Ministry — Steve Hendrikse

- Steve nominated **Mike Tunez** as new chairman of the Mercy Ministry committee
  - Mike has been active with the ministry over the past year and accepted the nomination
  - Committee oversees the Mercy Ministry fund, which assists church families and outside individuals with financial needs
- **Decision:** Unanimously approved Mike Tunez as Mercy Ministry Committee Chairman

### C. CarePortal — Steve Hendrikse

- Transition to other deacons continues (Chris, Mike, Iain trained on system)

### D. Hurricane Preparedness — Steve Hendrikse

- Steve stepping down from Diaconate but will continue leading hurricane preparedness through the summer
- Will revisit before hurricane season

### E. CPR Awareness — Rick Cook (Elder) & Jason Bogk

- Rick and Jason shared general CPR awareness guidance for the group
- Key points discussed:
  1. Call 911 immediately
  2. Check for responsiveness
  3. Begin chest compressions — push hard, push fast, center of chest
  4. If an AED is available, turn it on and follow the voice prompts
  5. Continue until EMS arrives
- Discussed location of AED on campus and importance of knowing where it is
- Informational discussion only — not a formal training or certification

## 5. Closing

- **Prayer:** *(TBD)*
- **Adjournment**
