## 4. Ministry Coordinator Updates

### A. Facilities — Tyrone Shire & Jonathan Colon

#### Cooling Tower / A/C Replacement

**Change Order #1 from Cool-Breeze Air Conditioning (Victor Henao, dated 02/05/26):**

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Original contract amount | $194,900.00 |
| Structural design, wind load calculations & drawings | $1,450.00 |
| Structural work, materials & permit | $8,850.00 |
| Electrical upgrades & permit | $9,800.00 |
| **Change order total** | **$20,100.00** |
| **Revised contract amount** | **$215,000.00** |

**Structural findings:**
- Base of cooling tower is cracked — cannot support new tower; must be replaced
- Four (4) new hot-dipped steel I-beams and engineer-specified anchors required
- Existing concrete crack must be patched

**Electrical findings:**
- All electrical disconnect boxes and conduits are heavily corroded (photos shared)
- Bare metal/wiring exposed to water — would not pass county inspection
- Circuits must be increased from 20 amps to 30 amps per tower
- Electrical scope: two (2) new NEMA 3, 30-amp disconnects for water pumps; two (2) new NEMA 3, 60-amp disconnects for cooling towers; reworking electrical piping for sprinkler system

**Other updates:**
- Mechanical and electrical plans completed by Francisco Garcia and Associates
- Permit application in process; Notice of Commencement submitted
- A/C equipment delayed due to weather — estimated arrival in Miami **02/13/26**
- Demolition and crane dates TBD; demo estimated 2–3 days
- Chemical water treatment system recommended for new cooling tower
- Jonathan exploring whether a family contact (electrician) could provide a cheaper quote, but group consensus was to stay with Cool-Breeze to avoid piecemealing

**Discussion:**
- Still within approved budget range
- Concern about delaying with summer approaching
- Having one contractor handle everything provides single point of accountability
- No sales tax (501(c)(3) status)

**Decision:** Unanimously approved Change Order #1 ($20,100) — proceed with Cool-Breeze for full scope including structural and electrical work.

**Payment:** 50% already paid on original contract; next payment at 70% milestone.

#### Termite Treatment

- Terminix quote ($98,764) approved at last meeting
- Quote has been sent to Session / Dina for final approval
- **Action Item:** Dina to present to Session for approval

#### Sanctuary Roof Beam Repairs

- Structural engineer has been assessing the situation (connected through Michael Capote)
- Engineer walked the property for over an hour, appears very knowledgeable
- **Preliminary recommendation:**
  - Cut deteriorated beam ends flush
  - Install metal supports from roof line
  - Lower the drainage/gutters so they cannot collect water and cause rot again
- Contractor: Fourth Generation Roofers (Robert) — familiar with this architecture
- Engineer recommends keeping copper material for gutters (longevity: 50+ years)
  - Copper is expensive but proven at this location
  - May be able to sell salvaged copper to offset cost
- Engineer has not yet presented formal plans — more details expected by next meeting
- Rob Nielsen (sales rep from earlier assessment) was also present; engineer asked the hard structural questions

#### Pews

- Doug Simpson attempted repair on a pew, threw out his back — cannot continue alone
- Plan: Cut 2x4 supports to reinforce sagging pews; Doug S. will do measuring/cutting
- **Volunteers to help:** Chris Lilburn, Joe (from church), Efrain, Mike
- **Coordinator:** Will Walker — will assess with Doug Simpson first, then schedule work day
- Longer-term: Pew replacement not in current budget; will reinforce and monitor
  - Track complaints and proactively check for failing pews to address before breakage

#### Youth Building

- Eric Benk (youth pastor) has a few items he'd like help with:
  - Remove a couch (take to dump)
  - Fix electrical outlets
  - Repair baseboards
- Eric to send a date; Adam will forward invite to group
- Moisture assessment on hold — free assessment available but remediation would be costly; waiting for more input from Eric

#### Facilities General Discussion

- Tyrone raised concern that Doug Simpson is overworked and facility needs more structured attention
- **Suggestion:** Commandeer one of the recently cleared upstairs rooms as a facilities office
  - Centralize documentation, work orders, and tracking
  - Use existing iMac computer upstairs for record-keeping
- Discussion about institutional knowledge being lost when people leave — need better documentation
- Discussion about potentially hiring labor help or planning for Doug S.'s eventual retirement
- Technology committee forming (Mark and others) — could help with documentation systems

### B. Mercy Ministry — Steve Hendrikse

- Steve nominated **Mike Tunez** as new chairman of the Mercy Ministry committee
  - Mike has been active with the ministry over the past year and accepted the nomination
  - Committee oversees the Mercy Ministry fund, which assists church families and outside individuals with financial needs
- **Decision:** Unanimously approved Mike Tunez as Mercy Ministry Committee Chairman

### C. CarePortal — Steve Hendrikse

- Transition to other deacons continues (Chris, Mike, Iain trained on system)

### D. Hurricane Preparedness — Steve Hendrikse

- Steve stepping down from Diaconate but will continue leading hurricane preparedness through the summer
- Will revisit before hurricane season

### E. CPR Awareness — Rick Cook (Elder) & Jason Bogk

- Rick and Jason shared general CPR awareness guidance for the group
- Key points discussed:
  1. Call 911 immediately
  2. Check for responsiveness
  3. Begin chest compressions — push hard, push fast, center of chest
  4. If an AED is available, turn it on and follow the voice prompts
  5. Continue until EMS arrives
- Discussed location of AEDs on campus — currently two units on site; importance of knowing where they are
- AED kits include scissors, a razor (for chest hair), and spare pads
- Informational discussion only — not a formal training or certification

**Questions & Discussion:**

- **Adult vs. pediatric pads?** — AEDs have both sets of pads in the bag. Default pads are for adults. Pediatric pads are for children roughly under 5 years old (based on age, not weight).
- **Do I need to do rescue breaths?** — Research shows compressions are the priority. There is enough oxygen in the system during the first few minutes of cardiac arrest. Focus on effective chest compressions rather than delaying to manage airway.
- **How long can one person do compressions?** — About 2 minutes of effective compressions before fatigue sets in. Rotate with a partner if available — don't stop compressions during the switch.
- **Can the AED shock the wrong rhythm?** — No. The AED analyzes the heart rhythm and will only deliver a shock if appropriate. You cannot override it. If no shock is needed, it will tell you to continue CPR.
- **What if I'm not sure there's a pulse?** — Even medical professionals can struggle with pulse checks. If someone is unresponsive and you're not confident you feel a pulse, start compressions. Better to act than wait.
- **What if I'm alone?** — Call 911 (or hit the emergency button on your phone), then start compressions. If the AED is just a few steps away, grab it first. If it's far, start compressions and call for someone to bring it.
- **Should we move the patient?** — If they collapse in a tight space (bathroom, between pews), move them to an area with more room to work. Think about access for when EMS arrives.
- **How close is EMS response?** — Fire/rescue is about two minutes away if units are not already on a call.
- **What if it happens during a service?** — Deacons and elders should form a shield around the patient for privacy. One person takes charge and calls the shots. Directly point to one specific person to call 911 — don't say "somebody call 911."
- **How hard do I push?** — About 2 inches deep. Hands interlaced, elbows straight, use your palms on the sternum. Breaking ribs is common, especially with older adults — keep going.
- **Can I use adult pads on a child (or vice versa)?** — Adult pads on a child: the AED will detect the smaller body and adjust the energy down. Pediatric pads on an adult: won't generate enough energy — use adult pads if available.
- **What if they're breathing but unconscious?** — Occasional gasping ("guppy breathing") is not effective breathing. If breathing seems ineffective and they're unresponsive, start compressions and put the AED on.
- **What if they don't make it?** — Even with perfect response, not every patient survives. Don't assume you did something wrong. Do the best you can.
- **How do I check the AED battery?** — Green light flashes every 3–4 seconds when battery is good. Rick checks them regularly; batteries replaced roughly every other year.
- **Where are the AEDs on campus?** — One in the church office (corner, marked "AED"), one on the front desk area.
- Rick and Jason offered to do a follow-up session on Stop the Bleed / wound care

## 6. Other Business

- Balcony closet has been cleaned out — items to go to the dumpster
  - Doug Simpson taking some today; need a couple of volunteers to help with the rest
  - Will Walker and Efrain Montesino to check what's there and verify nothing is being tossed that shouldn't be

## 7. Closing

- **Prayer:** Caleb Waller
- **Adjournment**
