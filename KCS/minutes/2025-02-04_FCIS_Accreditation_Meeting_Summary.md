## Auditor Insights & Recommendations

### On Fundraising Culture
> "You only get one shot at a five or six million dollar campaign... Most schools start with a pretty solid annual fund and get sixty to seventy percent participation before jumping into a capital campaign."

**Key points shared:**
- Building a "culture of giving" should precede any major capital campaign
- Annual fund infrastructure takes 10+ years to mature properly
- Database setup matters - tagging donations incorrectly creates cleanup issues for years
- Personal relationship building is critical - one auditor shared that a $2.5M gift came from a family relationship built over 10 years
- Consider hiring a consultant for board training on development (suggested: The Carter Group)

### On Director of Development
> "A great director of development is thinking about admissions, enrollment, campus appearance, community presence - not just fundraising."

**Recommendation:** This was a recommendation made 6 years ago at the last accreditation that hasn't been fulfilled. The auditors strongly emphasized:
- The Head of School cannot carry this burden alone
- Consider developing someone internally ("organic path") if budget is constrained
- Look for personality fit - someone who sees opportunities and isn't afraid to ask for money

### On Governance & Board Structure
> "The two things that can derail a school: governance and finance. If not strategically managed, that is a huge risk."

**Recommendations:**
- Grow the board with specialized expertise (finance, education, development)
- Create subcommittees (development committee, finance committee)
- Update the board manual - noted inconsistencies (e.g., manual says "no discounts" but discounts are given)
- Separate school policies from board policies - some items in board manual belong in faculty/staff handbook
- Board training resources: SCIS leadership training, ISM webinars, NAIS governance books

### On Strategic vs. Financial Planning
> "Your strategic plan currently does not match your financial plan at all. You're talking $100,000 a year on your financial plan, but your strategic plan talks millions."

**Insight:** The current strategic plan appears to combine a strategic plan and a master plan. Review and separate:
- **Strategic Plan:** 3-year achievable goals with budgeted resources
- **Master Plan:** 10-15 year vision (like the two-story building)

### On Capital Campaign Planning
> "Start with the end in mind. What is this building going to cost? Then work backwards."

**Recommended approach:**
1. Determine total building cost (suggested: ~$400-500/sq ft in Miami area)
2. Decide what debt load the church/school can handle
3. Ask: "What if we can't raise the full amount?"
4. Conduct a feasibility study ($25-30K investment)
5. Build annual fund culture FIRST
6. Then launch capital campaign

### On Church-School Relationship
**Current arrangement:** School pays church ~$342,000/year

**Auditor perspective:**
- This is a significant expense (~$13,000/month)
- As school grows and outperforms church financially, tensions can arise
- Consider strategic multi-year plan to adjust cost-sharing
- Example shared: One school took back $300-400K in expenses over 6-7 years through gradual annual negotiations
- Both parties should meet annually to review and agree on adjustments

## Action Items for the Board

### Immediate (Next 30-60 Days)
1. **Volunteer to review and update the Board Manual** - One board member offered to take this on
2. **Align strategic plan with financial plan** - Review which strategic items cost money and ensure budget reflects this
3. **Clarify annual fund goal** - Currently $100K for 2026; ensure board formally approves

### Short-Term (Next 3-6 Months)
4. **Get detailed building cost estimates** - "Dust off old plans" and get current pricing (~$325-500/sq ft)
5. **Determine acceptable debt load** - What if full capital campaign goal isn't met?
6. **Implement Razer's Edge correctly** - Invest time in proper setup to avoid database cleanup issues later
7. **Finalize oversight for donor software** - Parent volunteer (development professional) has offered to help

### Strategic (Next 6-12 Months)
8. **Hire or develop a Director of Development** - Consider internal candidate development if budget is constrained
9. **Conduct feasibility study** before capital campaign launch (~$25-30K investment)
10. **Consider board development training** - ISM, SCIS, NAIS resources available
11. **Build subcommittee structure** - Development committee, finance committee (can include non-board members)
12. **Review church-school cost-sharing agreement** - Consider gradual adjustment strategy
13. **Run Dazzle salary comparison** - Benchmark Head of School and teacher compensation against peer schools

### Governance
14. **Review board composition requirements** - Current constitution requires 60% church members, 40% PCA-related; assess if this limits recruiting needed expertise
15. **Plan for board chair succession** - Standard practice includes "past chair" advisory year
