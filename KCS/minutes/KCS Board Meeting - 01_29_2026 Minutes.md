**KCS Board Meeting Minutes**
**Thursday, 01/29/2026 6:00pm**

**Attending:**

* Gerald Zeidler, Chair and Board Moderator
* Terey Torralbas, Head of School
* Alexa DeAguero, Primary School Principal
* Kris Roth, Board Member
* Alfie Hernandez, Board Member
* Doug Hathaway, Board Secretary
* Jim Sue, Board Member
* Diane Lee, Board Member

**Absent:**

* Pastor James Drake (deployed overseas as military chaplain)

**6:00pm – Call to Order, Opening Prayer, Dinner Served**

Jerry called the meeting to order and opened with prayer. He prayed for **Pastor James Drake**, who has deployed overseas as a military chaplain with approximately 250–350 troops, asking for safety, provision for his family (including five children), and that the deployment would be fertile ground for the gospel. The Board briefly discussed Pastor Drake's family, noting that his oldest son is graduating from high school this year and has taken on additional responsibility at home during the deployment. Board members expressed concern and commitment to supporting the Drake family and praying for the troops.

Dinner was served.

Jerry shared a devotional from **Luke 10:21–24** and **Mark 10:13–15**, reflecting on Jesus sending out the seventy-two disciples and their joyful return. He highlighted that God reveals truth not to the "wise and learned" but to "little children" — emphasizing that this applies directly to the school's mission. Jesus said, *"Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them."* Jerry connected this to KCS's calling: the school has the great opportunity to expose children and their parents to the person and message of Jesus. He reminded the Board that while buildings, space, and programs are important, the core focus must remain on preaching the gospel in a way children can understand, trusting God to do His work in their hearts.

**Approval of Agenda and Previous Meeting Minutes**

* Minutes from the **12/11/2025** meeting were reviewed. Jerry noted that Doug had sent the minutes to Jerry and Terey for initial review, and Jerry then forwarded them to the full Board. Going forward, minutes will continue to be reviewed by Jerry and Terey before distribution.
* Diane made a motion to approve the agenda and prior meeting minutes.
  * Seconded, **M/S/P**.

**Board Chair Updates – Mr. Jerry Zeidler**

* **Welcome of New Board Member:**
  * Jerry formally welcomed **Alfie Hernandez** to the KCS Board of Trustees, noting that the Board had made the recommendation and the Session had approved his appointment.

* **Review of FCIS Standard 1: Mission**
  * As recommended during the FCIS accreditation pre-visit, the Board will now review one FCIS standard at each meeting. This practice demonstrates board engagement with accreditation standards and will be documented in meeting agendas and minutes.
  * **Standard 1 – Mission:** *"The school has a clearly articulated mission statement and educational philosophy that guide its operations. The mission statement is approved by the governing body, reviewed regularly, and communicated to all school constituencies."*
  * Terey reported the mission statement is prominently posted: on the school website, in every classroom and room, and on the campus mission walk (which was recently updated with new photographs and now reads "A Ministry of Christ Church Miami").
  * Jerry read the current mission statement aloud: *"Motivating students to be more Christ-like through Jesus Christ. Our mission is to motivate the next generation to independent Christian thinkers. Prepare lifelong learners to equip students with biblical truths to lead and serve in their church, community, country and the world."*
  * Jerry noted that in light of the evening's devotional, a future revision might consider adding language about knowing Christ (e.g., "to know Christ and to be more Christ-like"), but emphasized this was not a proposal for change at this time.
  * The Board reviewed and affirmed the current mission statement. No motion was required — the review satisfies the accreditation documentation requirement.
  * The next FCIS standard will be reviewed at the March meeting.

**Admissions Update – Mrs. Alexa DeAguero (on behalf of Sherril Nealey)**

* **2025–2026 Current Enrollment:** 471 students, though **three students will be withdrawn as of Monday** due to an immigration matter affecting the Reyes family. The mother has lost her Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and the family must return to Haiti. The family is devastated but hopeful they may return by August. Teachers at both campuses are sending the children off with classroom celebrations.
  * Board members also learned that **two school employees** are affected by immigration concerns: the school chef at the Kendall campus (currently unable to work) and another employee whose TPS expires in May. Both work for the Knight's Cafe.
  * At Jerry's request, a board member led the group in prayer for the affected families and employees.

* **Open House Restructuring:**
  * The admissions team has restructured the open house format. Instead of three smaller sessions per day, families now gather in a single larger group — in the sanctuary at Kendall or the chapel at Wayside — for a comprehensive presentation.
  * Administrators present on accreditation, the school's faith-based mission, Spanish immersion, nursing/health services, and early childhood programs.
  * The new format feels more personal and less rushed (~1.5 hours), allows parents to hear each other's questions, and gives staff time to mingle and answer follow-up questions afterward.
  * The team is also working on **filmed introductory videos** for each campus to supplement the in-person experience.
  * **Campus assignments:** Kindergarten through 6th grade open houses are held at Kendall; PreK4 and below are held at Wayside. Families may attend both.

* **Observations:**
  * K2 observations begin this Saturday with a group of twelve two-year-olds.
  * Observations focus on developmental readiness — transitions from parents, eye contact, name response, social readiness — not academic knowledge. The school emphasized to prospective families that KCS is a **traditional school, not Montessori**, with clear expectations for student readiness.

* **Acceptance Video:**
  * A new acceptance video was presented to the Board (with minor technical difficulties during the demo). The video is sent to accepted families via email link and features campus footage and welcoming messages from staff.
  * Families have responded enthusiastically, with some calling the school in tears of excitement after receiving the video.
  * Additionally, the school is introducing **swag bags** for newly accepted students: t-shirts with the KCS bear for preschoolers and branded water bottles for elementary students.

**Finance Office Update – Ms. Kris Roth (on behalf of Ana Prinz)**

* **Flourish Investment Update**
  * As of December 7, 2025, the Flourish account balance stands at approximately **$1.4 million**.
  * Calendar year-to-date interest earned: **$40,589**.
  * Interest earned from November 8 to December 7: **$3,184**.
  * Kris noted that interest income was not included as a revenue source in the current year's budget (planned for next year's budget), which she prefers as a cushion given spending trends.

* **December 2025 Financial Report**
  * The school is currently **$141,000 behind budget**, a significant variance that warrants attention.
  * **Revenue shortfall (~$50,000):**
    * ~$28,000 due to student attrition and tuition refunds.
    * ~$25,000 in unbudgeted staff tuition discounts for newly hired employees with children enrolled at KCS. This alone nearly erases the school's budgeted surplus for the year.
  * **Expense overruns (~$50,000+):**
    * Building maintenance, campus enhancements, and grounds maintenance are **$50,000 over budget** year-to-date, with building maintenance alone showing a **$31,000 variance**.
    * Many expenditures were driven by accreditation preparation (e.g., front entrance crack/tripping hazard repairs) and general campus upkeep.
    * Security staffing is also burning through its budget; a possible reduction of one security guard was mentioned.
  * **Year-over-year comparison:** The school is approximately **$400,000 behind the prior year's position**, a figure Kris noted is difficult to fully explain at this point.
  * **Capitalization of expenses:** Kris emphasized that campus improvements costing more than **$1,000** should be **capitalized as assets**, not expensed to the P&L. This would reduce the apparent operating loss. She noted that the church operates on a cash basis (does not capitalize assets), while the school uses accrual accounting, creating discrepancies when shared expenses are recorded differently.
  * **Shared church/school expenses:** Some items pre-approved as church responsibility (e.g., roof repairs) may still be hitting the school's operating budget. The accounting treatment needs clarification.
  * Terey noted that when she reviewed detailed reports before Christmas break, she found multiple items miscategorized (e.g., expenses in professional development that belonged elsewhere). Corrections were made, but further review is needed.
  * **Budget methodology concern:** Kris noted that the current budget is distributed evenly across months (total divided by 10 or 12), rather than reflecting when expenses actually occur (e.g., event spending concentrated in December and May). This means monthly budget-vs-actual comparisons can be misleading. She recommended that future budgets align budget allocations to the months expenses are actually incurred, providing a more accurate picture of financial health.
  * Terey confirmed that Anna (finance) has been taking a **conservative approach to expense approvals**, saying no to requests and requiring them to be escalated through the chain. Kris affirmed this is appropriate — Anna should be the "no" at the first level, with Terey providing final approval when warranted.
  * Terey noted that the school went through a similar situation last year where the numbers appeared alarming, but the school ended the year in a sound position. She believes the current variance is more a function of accounting categorization than actual overspending.
  * **Potential outside financial review:** Jerry raised the possibility of engaging **Tom Gonzales**, a church member who serves as a controller for a much larger organization, to provide a fresh set of eyes on the school's financials — either as a consultant or potentially as a future board member. The Board discussed confidentiality considerations, given that Mr. Gonzales is well-known in the school community. No decision was made; the Board agreed to consider this if financial questions remain unresolved by year-end.

* **Windstorm Payment ($200/month)**
  * Kris raised a concern about the **$200 monthly payment** the school makes to the church, which is intended as a designated contribution for windstorm damage reserves. She noted that there is **no active windstorm insurance policy** on the property, and she does not believe the church is treating these payments as a designated contribution on its books.
  * Terey indicated this arrangement was established under prior administration and may have been an error. She suggested discontinuing the payment.
  * The Board agreed the matter needs resolution: either the church properly designates the funds or the school stops the payments. To be addressed in the upcoming joint finance meeting.

* **Shared Expenses – Church and School**
  * **Rise in Utilities:** Georgina provided a **six-month comparison** (June 30 – December 31, 2024 vs. same period 2025) showing significant increases:
    * Waste management: up **$1,500**
    * Water: up **$4,071**
    * Electricity: up **~$3,000**
    * **Total six-month increase: $8,567**, projected to **$13,000–$14,000** annually.
  * The increase is **not driven by enrollment growth** (approximately two fewer students than the prior year). Rather, the church's increased use of the facility — Monday Bible study, Tuesday sharing circle, Wednesday family nights and community groups using the cafeteria, media center, and art room — is contributing to higher utility and waste costs.
  * The school currently carries approximately **70–90%** of shared utility costs. Kris recommended reassessing the church/school expense split, particularly as the church continues to grow and increase its campus usage.
  * **Summer Months:** Terey noted the school will **not operate a summer camp** this year and will only use the office during summer months. She requested that the Session consider a reduction in the school's share of shared expenses during the summer. Jerry directed that this be taken up at the Deacon Finance Committee meeting.
  * Jerry noted that the last joint meeting with the Deacon finance committee discussed adopting the **Westminster Academy model** (Fort Lauderdale), which calculates shared costs based on square footage and usage time. This is still being discussed but could potentially shift costs away from the school. Jerry cautioned it could also work to the school's detriment depending on the analysis.
  * Jerry also noted that future **county sewer connection** (previously discussed) will likely increase water/sewer bills further.

* **Action Items – Finance:**
  * Kris will schedule a meeting with **Anna** (finance) and **Georgina** (institutional knowledge) after the accreditation visit to review maintenance and building expense details, ensure proper capitalization, and reconcile budget categories.
  * Terey is implementing a new **departmental budget accountability system**: each department head/teacher will receive their budget allocation and be responsible for tracking spending against it. This has never been done before at KCS and is expected to significantly improve visibility and accountability.
  * A **joint meeting with the Deacon finance committee** is targeted for the **March timeframe** to revisit the church/school expense split, utility allocation, windstorm payments, and square footage analysis.
  * The Board will consider engaging **Tom Gonzales** for an outside financial review if questions persist.

  * Kris explained the difference between **cash basis and accrual/capitalization accounting** for the benefit of the full Board. She noted that the church's reported ~$200,000 loss was largely due to expensing all improvements (roof, A/C, painting, pews) in the year incurred rather than capitalizing them. The school's capitalization policy (items over ~$1,000 with useful life beyond one year) avoids this. Discussion followed about whether the church — with a budget under $500,000 — should consider moving to accrual accounting as it grows. Jerry noted the church is transitioning to a new accounting system.
  * **Sewer project expenses:** Kris noted that engineering fees, legal/zoning fees, and other costs related to the middle school expansion and sewer project should be classified as **construction-in-progress** (capitalized), not expensed to the P&L. She suspects some of these costs may have been incorrectly recorded under building maintenance, contributing to the budget variance. Terey confirmed she labels approved middle school expenses accordingly but agreed to follow up with Anna to verify proper treatment.

**School Updates – Ms. Terey Torralbas, Head of School**

* **Church/School Weekly Operations Meeting**
  * Terey and Alice (church administrator) have begun meeting on a **weekly private basis** to coordinate church and school operations, separate from the church's regular weekly staff meetings. A school representative still attends the beginning of the church meeting for prayer and general updates, but the private meetings allow for more focused coordination to avoid scheduling conflicts and operational overlap.

* **Sewer Project Update**
  * The project remains in early stages. Deposits have been paid to the civil engineers, and the team is currently providing surveys and answering preliminary questions. No significant updates beyond what was reported in December. All sewer project costs are to be capitalized as construction-in-progress.

* **FCIS Accreditation Visit – February 4, 2026**
  * The visiting team (10 members) arrives **Tuesday, February 3** for a campus tour and evening session. Terey and Alfie will attend the Tuesday evening meeting; other Board members are not required Tuesday.
  * **Board members are asked to attend Wednesday, February 4**, arriving at the Main Office by approximately **10:45–11:00am**. The team will walk the Board to the Media Center for an interview session expected to last **less than one hour**.
  * Terey distributed **sample interview questions** in the Board folders. She noted that while these are standard training questions given to visiting teams, each team develops its own questions based on their study of the school. Key topics the Board should be prepared to address:
    * **School safety and security** — a concern raised in the prior accreditation evaluation. What has the Board done to address this?
    * **First rights / church-school relationship** — If the church were ever to cease operations, what protections exist for KCS? The school has reported on the church's rebranding, new pastor, and improved position, but the accreditors will want to see **concrete action**, not just discussion. This is Terey's primary concern — she does not want the school to be flagged as being at risk. Six years have passed since the last accreditation (extended due to the pandemic).
    * **Board roles and governance** — Board size (relatively small for a school of this size), succession planning, recruitment, and governance training. Board members have attended SCIS governance workshops (Kris, Doug, and others in recent years).
    * **Strategic planning** — How is the Board involved? The Board should be honest about areas of growth while demonstrating awareness and progress toward better alignment with FCIS expectations.
    * **Support of the Head of School** — How does the Board support Terey and the administration?
    * **Middle school expansion** — What is the Board doing to support the launch and growth of the upper school?
    * **Fundraising and financial planning** — What role does the Board play in campaigns and long-term financial sustainability? The prior accreditation recommended hiring a **Director of Advancement**; the school currently does not have one. The Board should be prepared to discuss this.
    * **Board financial contributions** — It is customary (and an FCIS expectation) that board members personally contribute financially to the school.
  * Terey reassured the Board that the accreditation team is **supportive, not adversarial**. This is a re-accreditation, and the school's most recent audit was clean. The team will review the prior year's audit, not current monthly financials.
  * Alexa confirmed from her own experience serving on accreditation teams that the encounters are positive and recommendation-oriented.
  * The role of the **PTF (Parent-Teacher Fellowship)** was clarified: PTF focuses on community events, parent involvement, and teacher support — not fundraising campaigns. Fundraising has historically been handled by administration (previously by the former Head of School, now by Terey with consultant support).

* **Upper School Development**
  * **Marketing:** Sherril Nealey visited five K–5 schools this week to distribute middle school flyers and build awareness. KCS is well known for preschool and elementary but needs to establish its identity as a middle school. Outreach and marketing efforts are ongoing.
  * **Honors Track:** The inaugural sixth grade class will follow an **honors track** with academically advanced coursework. Administration is being selective with admissions to ensure the first class can handle the rigor. Current K–3 MAP assessment scores are strong; the incoming cohort from fourth grade is well-positioned for future years. The school is aiming for approximately **15 students** (minimum) in the first sixth grade class, with capacity up to 20–22. Administration does not expect to reach the maximum in the first year, as many families are cautious about being "first."
  * **Staffing:** The sixth grade will be staffed primarily through **internal reassignment** — no new full-time hires are planned for the first year. Ms. Jones (originally hired to teach middle school) will teach fifth and sixth grade math. A language arts/Spanish immersion teacher will cover fifth grade Spanish immersion and sixth grade language arts. A part-time science hire may be needed. The model is middle school style (students rotating between classes), with scheduling designed to accommodate shared teachers across fifth and sixth grades. Mrs. Pericles (Upper School Principal) is helping build the program.
  * **Young Life Sponsorship:** Terey has connected with **Young Life** to offer middle school retreats and camps. KCS contributed a sponsorship to an upcoming Young Life event, and the school's logo will appear as a "Friends of Young Life" sponsor. This supports the upper school marketing and brand-building effort.
  * **Spill Out Area:** The Session has approved removal of the green gate near the library. Over the summer, that area will be converted into a **"spill out" area** — a designated middle school hangout space with age-appropriate furniture and snacks. This is a common feature at middle schools and will help the middle schoolers feel distinct from the elementary program. The space will also be available for the church's youth program. A **putt-putt feature** is being considered for the end of the hallway. A hallway TV displaying middle school announcements is also planned. Funding will come from the annual fund.
  * The **robotics program** will continue and extend to the middle school.

* **Uknight Annual Fund**
  * KCS is replacing the former "Give Miami Day" approach with a formal **annual fund called "Uknight."**
  * Based on research and consultant guidance, schools of KCS's size (~$7.6M annual budget) typically raise **5–10% of their annual budget** through annual giving. KCS has never approached this level; the most raised in a single year was approximately **$150,000** (Terey's first year, via Give Miami Day).
  * The annual fund is intended to provide the surplus needed for facility improvements, technology replacement (e.g., smartboards nearing end of life at ~$5,000 each), field updates, and other projects that tuition alone cannot cover.
  * **Launch:** Third week of February (week of Presidents Day), Tuesday through Friday, followed by the **Knight's Fest** celebration on Saturday.
  * **First-year goal: $75,000** (intentionally conservative to begin building a culture of giving).
  * Kris noted that $75,000 across ~470 students equals roughly $150 per student; reaching the 5–10% target ($400,000–$800,000) would require approximately $1,000 per student. Terey explained that annual funds do not rely on equal per-student contributions but rather on identifying key donors who give significantly more, alongside broader participation.
  * **School Improvement Fee:** Currently collected as a separate fee in June, which creates a "I already gave" mentality. Consultants recommend **folding this fee into tuition** in a future year so that annual giving becomes a separate, additive expectation. This cannot be changed for the upcoming school year (already announced) but is a future consideration.
  * Terey emphasized this is a **culture shift** that will take time — families need to understand that tuition covers operations, not growth.

* **Capital Campaign 2026–2027**
  * **"One Shot" Approach:** Terey expressed strong conviction that the school has **one chance** to execute this campaign successfully. The previous capital campaign (~2020) lost momentum during the pandemic and left unresolved issues — a fundraising thermometer that sat in the parking lot for years without movement, donor recognition items (bricks, wall plaques) that were promised but never delivered, and a part-time advancement hire who did not follow through on commitments to business sponsors. Some affected families are still enrolled. The donor recognition tree (which included Jerry's name) was eventually removed because it had become a reminder of unfulfilled commitments.
  * **Campaign target:** Approximately **$5 million** for the middle school building and campus expansion.
  * Terey shared that attempting a campaign of this scale without professional support could take 25+ years. With professional systems and strategy, timelines compress significantly.
  * **Proposal – Razor's Edge / Blackbaud:**
    * Terey has been consulting with a firm that works with many FCIS schools (including Westminster Academy) and recommends the **Blackbaud / Razor's Edge** platform.
    * The platform provides donor management, analytics, email campaigns, pledge tracking, and — critically — **donor research capabilities**: it connects with the school's parent portal and uses public records (business ownership, philanthropy history) to identify families with giving potential.
    * The platform also provides coaching and consulting on advancement strategy — teaching Terey how to identify prospects, sequence asks, and plan campaign events.
    * Kris noted from her professional experience that Razor's Edge is widely used in advancement and is excellent for tracking, but emphasized that the system requires data and human effort to be effective — it does not replace a dedicated advancement person.
    * Terey acknowledged the school ultimately needs a **Director of Advancement** (a salary comparable to the Head of School), but is not there yet. In the interim, she is working with a paid fundraising consultant and Mrs. Pericles, and has restructured her team to free up her own time for advancement work.
    * The campaign will require approximately **one year of preparation** (research, donor identification, renderings, event planning) before a public launch.
  * **1973 Society:**
    * Named for the school's **founding year (1973)**, this is a founding-member giving society with a **$1,973 pledge**.
    * Perks include dinner with administration, name recognition, and other benefits.
    * Terey personally called families to secure verbal commitments in advance of the board meeting. As of tonight, **9 families have pledged, totaling $17,757**. No one declined.
    * The 1973 Society will launch alongside the Uknight annual fund. Initial pledges are intended to cover the cost of the Blackbaud/Razor's Edge platform.
    * Terey requested the Board's **green light to sign the Razor's Edge contract** and move forward.
  * **Advancement Consultant – Ms. Donate:**
    * Terey identified a current preschool parent, **Ms. Donate**, who is a professional advancement/fundraising consultant. She previously led a campaign for Baptist Health that raised approximately $617 million. She has recently started her own firm and has expressed strong interest in working with KCS.
    * Terey requested Board authorization to explore an engagement, potentially on a **percentage-of-funds-raised basis** rather than a flat fee, which would align incentives and reduce upfront cost.
    * Kris expressed initial concern about committing to platform costs given the $141,000 budget shortfall, but was encouraged by the prospect of a professional advancement person. She emphasized that the platform alone will not generate donations — the "asking" is a specialized talent that requires the right person.
    * Alfie supported moving forward, noting that the school needs to start somewhere and that the platform cost is effectively covered by the 1973 Society pledges. He framed the capital campaign as a multi-step process, with this platform purchase being an early step, far from the eventual building construction.
  * **Namings Discussion:**
    * Terey raised the possibility of allowing **naming opportunities** for major donors (e.g., naming a building or space after a significant contributor). She noted that a current family — which has a building named after them at Columbus — could be a major donor but may expect naming recognition.
    * Jerry stated that the **prior policy decision** was that no names would be associated with the property: *"We honor one name and that is Jesus Christ."* Previous namings (Leslie Hall, Pellman Room) have been taken down.
    * Alfie suggested a possible compromise — allowing donors to select a **scripture reference** or other personalization rather than a personal name.
    * Jerry indicated this would need to be **discussed again with the Session**, as it touches on church policy regarding the property.
  * **Privacy and Donor Research:**
    * Jerry raised a broader concern about the intersection of professional fundraising and church values. He noted that the Session has historically maintained strict **confidentiality around giving** — no one other than the church bookkeeper knows individual giving amounts. While KCS is a school, it operates on church property and is part of the church ministry, and this tension should be considered.
    * Alfie drew a distinction: tithing to the church is a biblical obligation with different privacy expectations, whereas donations to the school are voluntary and giving families are making a joyful, non-obligatory choice to support the institution. The fundraising platform is about identifying willingness and capacity, not compulsion.

  * **Board Discussion and Motion:**
    * Discussion clarified that the Razor's Edge platform is a **fundraising and donor management tool** for ongoing annual giving and future campaign support — it is separate from the capital campaign building decisions (bonds, construction contracts, etc.).
    * Jerry initially had concerns about approving the platform without the broader capital campaign strategy being defined, but the Board clarified that the platform serves the annual fund and general advancement, independent of whether the school eventually pursues bonds or other financing for construction.
    * Jerry asked whether a failed fundraising effort with this platform would "blow the one shot" at the capital campaign. Terey confirmed it would not — the "one shot" refers to the capital campaign launch itself, not the tools used to build toward it.
    * Two separate actions were discussed:
      1. Approval to purchase the Blackbaud/Razor's Edge platform (4-year contract, funded by 1973 Society pledges)
      2. Authorization for Terey to explore an engagement with Ms. Donate as advancement consultant

    * **Motion 1 — Razor's Edge Platform:**
      * Kris moved to approve a four-year contract for the parent-funded Blackbaud/Razor's Edge fundraising platform.
      * Alfie seconded.
      * Jerry abstained. He noted that while the Board has authority to make this decision, the Session should be made aware. Alfie responded that this is an operational software decision well within the Board's authority, comparable to purchasing curriculum tools, and does not require Session approval. The Board concurred.
      * **Motion passed.**

    * **Motion 2 — Advancement Position:**
      * Diane moved to find a compensated advancement position/officer to implement the Razor's Edge platform and lead fundraising.
      * Alfie seconded.
      * **M/S/P.**

  * **Namings Discussion (continued):**
    * Kris recommended that the naming question be formally referred to the Session for a definitive policy statement on whether names may be placed on buildings or spaces.
    * Doug suggested that the **1973 Society could incorporate tiered recognition levels** (e.g., platinum, gold) as an alternative to building naming — with donor names published in an annual booklet or report rather than on permanent signage. This would allow major donors to be recognized without departing from the existing policy.
    * Terey expressed support for this approach and noted plans to create such a booklet.
    * The Board agreed to **add the naming policy question to the Session addendum** for formal discussion and resolution.

**Addendum: Topics for Next Session/Deacon Meeting**
*(Per Jerry Zeidler's request)*

The Board recommends the following topics be placed on the agenda for the next Session and/or Deacon Finance Committee meeting:

1. **Church/School Shared Expense Split** — Reassess the current allocation (school carries ~70–90%) in light of increased church facility usage (Bible study, sharing circle, family nights, community groups). Consider adopting a square-footage/usage-time model (Westminster Academy approach). Include analysis of utility increases ($8,567 over six months).

2. **Summer Months Allocation** — The school will not operate a summer camp in 2026–2027 and will only use office space during summer. The Board requests consideration of a reduced school share during summer months.

3. **Windstorm Payment ($200/month)** — The school currently pays the church $200/month as a designated contribution for windstorm reserves. There is no active windstorm policy, and the funds do not appear to be designated on the church's books. Recommend either formalizing the designation or discontinuing the payment.

4. **Naming Policy** — The Board requests a definitive Session policy on whether donor names may be placed on school/church buildings or spaces. The current understanding is that the policy prohibits naming (previous namings have been removed). The Board suggests the 1973 Society tiered recognition model (annual booklet/report) as a potential alternative. A clear policy is needed before the capital campaign launches.

5. **County Sewer Connection** — The Deacons should be aware that the planned sewer connection will increase water/sewer bills for the shared campus.

6. **Church Accounting Practices** — As the church budget grows, consider whether transitioning from cash basis to accrual accounting (with asset capitalization) would be beneficial. The church is already transitioning to a new accounting system.

7. **Tom Gonzales** — A church member who serves as a controller for a large organization. The Board identified him as a potential resource — either as a board member, financial consultant, or outside reviewer — if financial questions persist. Confidentiality considerations apply.
